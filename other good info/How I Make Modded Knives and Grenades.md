# How I Make Modded Knives and Grenades  
*Borderlands 4 Serial Item Codes (Focus: Purple Tier Only)*

---

**This tutorial is focused specifically on modding knives and grenades in Borderlands 4 using serial codes, and it works best for purple-tier gear. Legendary tier items generally won’t keep perks and are much less stable or consistent under this method.**

---

## Quick Reference: Successful Code Combos

- Combine a base grenade or knife code with bonus segments from other serials.
- Example usage: Add a new bomb or blade effect to a purple grenade or knife for custom results.
- Works best: Purples only!
- Doesn't work: Legendary items (they usually lose perks or break).

## Step-by-Step Modding Process

### 1. Select Your Base Code

Pick the serial code of the knife or grenade you want to edit.  
Example:

@Uge8Xtm/)}}!eoe`L{(~iG&cl_)R9a8

text

---

### 2. Choose a Source Code With Desired Parts

Find a serial from another item that has the part/feature you want to add.  
Example:

@Uge8Xtm/)}}!epwTL{(~iG&cl_*bz?v

### 3. Copy the Specific Segment

Extract only the part you want from the donor code.  
For instance:

G&cl_*bz?v

text

---

### 4. Combine to Create a Custom Serial

Attach the extra segment to the end of your base code.  
Example:

@Uge8Xtm/)}}!eoe`L{(~iG&cl_)R9a8G&cl_*bz?v

text

### 5. Example of Real Usage

Suppose you have a purple grenade mod code and want to add a unique cluster effect from another code:

- Base grenade code:  
  `@Uge8Xtm/)}}!fbw^L{(~iG(4n-Xc0{SG&<ym$Pr8c`
- Segment to add:  
  `G&cl(4n-`
- Resulting code:  
  `@Uge8Xtm/)}}!fbw^L{(~iG(4n-Xc0{SG&<ym$Pr8cG&cl(4n-`

This gives your base grenade the additional effect from the second code, as long as both pieces are from purple-tier gear.

## Rules, Notes, and Troubleshooting

- Only stack onto clean (unedited) items. Layering stacked codes will usually break the item.
- Test new codes one at a time. If you lose perks, start again with a fresh purple.
- You can merge similar code sections (such as “G&” and “G(”) for added effects, but always from purples.
- Legendary items almost always lose functionality or perks using these methods.

## Tips for Success

1. **Stay with purple gear** (Just for this tutorial and the items being discussed—it's not required for all modding): You’ll get more consistent results and run into fewer glitches for knives and grenades.
2. **Back up your saves:** Always keep a backup before testing new codes.
3. **For rare combos:** Try donor codes from community item repositories for more possibilities.
