[9/19/2025 12:08 AM] levo1106_43528
Honestly the last thing I would need to finish out my build would be a slightly better role on my class mod, and to get amp+splash dmg on the repkit along with high caliber or trickshot


[9/19/2025 12:08 AM] levo1106_43528
so I might brute force one of those roles


[9/19/2025 12:49 AM] rabiddementia
Is there anyone that happens to know if the string code for this exact build by chance?

Weapon code I've deciphered so far
```@Ug = item creation
4-9 # = manufacturer and weapon type
Example: 
d_t@ = jakobs shotgun
bV{r = jakobs pistol
y3L+2} = jakobs sniper

eU_{ = maliwan shotgun
w$Yw2} = maliwan SMG

velk2} = vladof AR
xFw!2} = vladof SMG

xp/&2} = ripper Sniper

ct)% = torgue pistol

fs(8 = Daedalus AR

b)Kv = order pistol
y>^2} = order sniper

after is TYg or Fme!K not sure of it's use```

good work, i've been under the assumtion that the Fme!k was shotgun as in family, and RG is the jakobs effect richochet. but ive only been mutating th jakobs shotty so far.

The issue is half of the code is specific stats and/or parts that share some resemblances but don't know what they do

what type of mag?


[9/19/2025 2:22 AM] akamoden
CoV is one and the other acutally changed the gun to oscar mike, but for the most park it would change the legendary effect. since the gun wasnt acutally working i cant really tell i only know that CoV and Oscar mike showed up because it showed on the effects list


[9/19/2025 2:23 AM] akamoden
maybe im wrong? maybe that is the legendary effect spot?

what are you using to get that? all im doing is removing parts of the string and grafting them onto other ends or replacing etc.

it wont nearly be as hard as we understand what each chunk does.

Step 3: Hypothesis

The first divergent chunk after skeleton = roll bundle (rarity + main stat scaling + mag size).

The RG/ marker = licensed Torgue manufacturer attachment (gives the 13–17% explosion buff).

The post-RG/ suffix = secondary part modifiers (reload, splash, bullet speed). just feed chatgpt

I don't want to add more stuff to my bl4-crypt tool as of yet. So many people are working on GUIs etc, why should I even bother ^^

If you have that item, you have to use the save decryptor, otherwise there's not a way to generate items yet.

[9/19/2025 2:29 PM] cr4nkst4r
Maybe you can figure out why the UI is bugged so often with marking items as trash in a completely different row xDD
Sent them the fix so I am not getting annoyed that often 😄


[9/19/2025 2:29 PM] flicqt
So


[9/19/2025 2:30 PM] flicqt
Yeah you have the audio issue too where it sounds like it's infinite scrolling or hovering over an item?


[9/19/2025 2:30 PM] flicqt
I think it's some sort of refresh capture they do in the background that breaks, I also think this stacks till you eventually crash. Could take hours or less.


[9/19/2025 2:30 PM] cr4nkst4r
I've had plenty of audio issues, mainly with them not present, but not this one


[9/19/2025 2:31 PM] cr4nkst4r
Yea as soon as something with my inv. breaks, I know, I'll have a crash in my gaming session 😄


[9/19/2025 2:31 PM] flicqt
Hmm interesting, yeah the second I open my inventory I get this audio bug, goes away when it "finds" all items even though I see them right away.


[9/19/2025 2:31 PM] flicqt
But the hover is extremely delayed when junking


[9/19/2025 2:32 PM] cr4nkst4r

They're using some jank version of some homebrew Angular, and it's rough. Also noticed that since everything is rendered via Web, they load multiple DOM's at once

@Cr4nkSt4r @Flic @akamoden @Rxckstvr @Hobamj @Maple @watch ur girl @infamousjak 

I put together some findings based on all the back and forth in this channel in a doc. Hopefully it helps and I didn't waste my time lol

The link is open for all to update as you wish.

hell yeah, I am currently compiling a draw.io that I'll eventually host on a gdrive with a dump of changes per each symbol and a-z. doing it on the augment knife as a base


[9/19/2025 4:16 PM] flicqt
so we can see visual impact on the items


[9/19/2025 4:21 PM] flicqt
well already found an interesting observation on the augment knife


[9/19/2025 4:22 PM] flicqt
I only changed the last letter and it changed the tier of Firmware

as you can see here changed the letter again and we got a different firmware entirely

[9/19/2025 4:28 PM] flicqt
so final letter appears to dictate some part of firmware, gonna try another run with changing the letter before it M to something else, since the original was Md for tier 3 RubberBandMan and lowecase Ms was still rubberband but tier 1. I want to throw this test forward one letter before exploring the possible Firmware options by just changing one letter to ensure it's not that simple.


[9/19/2025 4:46 PM] flicqt
so far in a few tests

[9/19/2025 4:47 PM] flicqt
it also changed the firmware back to rubberband man :hmm:


[9/19/2025 4:48 PM] s4mzy.
and it is useable?

Could you make out the part in the code that you have changed so we can reference it to other guns?

[9/19/2025 4:58 PM] flicqt
yes


[9/19/2025 4:58 PM] flicqt
I changed K


[9/19/2025 4:58 PM] s4mzy.
just saw this thank you!


[9/19/2025 4:58 PM] flicqt
I am documenting all of it in a draw.io


[9/19/2025 4:58 PM] flicqt
that I will share


[9/19/2025 4:59 PM] flicqt
so the original was ``` @Ugr$WBm/)}}$pj+I-U)itpw>roL#{/A`6LMd ``` I changed it to ----> ``` @Ugr$WBm/)}}$pj+I-U)itpw>roL#{/A`6KDd ```


[9/19/2025 5:00 PM] flicqt
Dd changed it to tier 1 rubberband and K changed the part


[9/19/2025 5:00 PM] s4mzy.
@SalientMe but i believe Fme!K       / }TY*   represent lvl 50 but changes for assualt rifles and snipers then fme! is for shotguns and pistols


[9/19/2025 5:00 PM] s4mzy.
but it could have been proven otherwise


[9/19/2025 5:04 PM] femmadi
TY seems to also apply to SMGs


[9/19/2025 5:04 PM] s4mzy.
^


[9/19/2025 5:04 PM] s4mzy.
i believe this is to do with the level of the gun but changes depending on the type of gun such as “Fme!” is for : Shotguns and Pistols. Then “}TYg” represents: SMGs, Assault Rifles, Snipers.


[9/19/2025 5:05 PM] femmadi
I’m trying to figure out how to change elements right now with that doc but might be better off waiting a little longer till everyone knows more

[9/19/2025 5:06 PM] s4mzy.
honestly just play around and find out


[9/19/2025 5:06 PM] s4mzy.
i would recommend getting multiple "hot sluggers"


[9/19/2025 5:06 PM] s4mzy.
as apparently the hot sugger doesnt change parts


[9/19/2025 5:06 PM] s4mzy.
they are set to always be the same basically

I’m trying to look for common factors, but damn, looking in notepad ++ for 3 hours gives you a headache :laughUmaru:

tell me about it i was going crazy last night


[9/19/2025 5:07 PM] cr4nkst4r
Do you have all 4 codes to copy paste?
idk if one is an uppercase i or an lowercase L


[9/19/2025 5:07 PM] flicqt
yes


[9/19/2025 5:07 PM] femmadi
But I think I’m looking at something right now, I’m gonna copy some slots, mess with some stuff and see what the result is


[9/19/2025 5:08 PM] s4mzy.
try to have a record of everything you do


[9/19/2025 5:08 PM] s4mzy.
so we can then see later on what has changed and what caused that change


[9/19/2025 5:09 PM] femmadi
Sounds good


[9/19/2025 5:09 PM] femmadi
Also that’s kinda why I’m gonna copy the guns and mess with them


[9/19/2025 5:09 PM] femmadi
For I have base of them to see exactly what’s the outcome

also WBM/ seems to be what makes a knife lvl 50


[9/19/2025 5:12 PM] s4mzy.
which might be worth putting in the doc


[9/19/2025 5:13 PM] s4mzy.
what did u change?

think i got a broken gun XD


[9/19/2025 5:14 PM] s4mzy.
yeah thats common because when one gun gets corrupted it wants to corrupt your backpack too


[9/19/2025 5:16 PM] flicqt
yeah cause you have to put the item in the backpack slot too


[9/19/2025 5:17 PM] flicqt
a fake "reserved" slot


[9/19/2025 5:17 PM] s4mzy.
yeah the item code that you swap you should ctrl f to find the other one of it


[9/19/2025 5:18 PM] femmadi
Ok reversed one gun and everything’s good


[9/19/2025 5:18 PM] femmadi
Maybe not


[9/19/2025 5:28 PM] s4mzy.
@MadiMads what are u changing to the guns?


[9/19/2025 5:28 PM] s4mzy.
as there may be checks preventing certain changes


[9/19/2025 5:28 PM] femmadi
Right now, trying to see about changing elements. But unsure


[9/19/2025 5:29 PM] s4mzy.
which part do u think the "element" is tied to?


[9/19/2025 5:29 PM] flicqt
@Cr4nkSt4r got a new one

Tried changing (M) to J, K, L, O with the same ending of Dd all broke the knife.

try changing the "p~j)" part


[9/19/2025 5:41 PM] s4mzy.
as i think that might be elemental


[9/19/2025 5:41 PM] s4mzy.
or a stat on the gun

tbh for this gun im just tryna remove tediore and add jakobs

or maliwan whatever i got to remove


[9/19/2025 5:42 PM] s4mzy.
then that would be ugxf

have you tried modifying anything past ^p@, like u#H` try changing H to D


[9/19/2025 5:43 PM] flicqt
that would change the entire manufacturer though no?


[9/19/2025 5:44 PM] flicqt
they want to change the part to Jakobs


[9/19/2025 5:44 PM] flicqt
so vladof with jakobs richochet


[9/19/2025 5:44 PM] s4mzy.
yeah so they would want to change it to Ugdt

[9/19/2025 5:45 PM] flicqt
they're hunting for a part and that's what I'm trying to figure out with knifes, I think other items might follow the same logic


[9/19/2025 5:45 PM] femmadi
and if possible keep the maliwan part for enhancement, so have vladof rad, with jakobs and maliwan extra parts


[9/19/2025 5:45 PM] femmadi
if not possible for that parts combo its whatever


[9/19/2025 5:45 PM] s4mzy.

HOW

[9/19/2025 5:52 PM] s4mzy.
okay but this is a smg


[9/19/2025 5:52 PM] s4mzy.
and...


[9/19/2025 5:52 PM] flicqt
so sometimes the last letter dictates a change, sometimes it doesn't, but the first letter K won't work with Dd, but if I do KDa it fixes the knife


[9/19/2025 5:52 PM] flicqt
:Huh:


[9/19/2025 5:53 PM] s4mzy.
knives are in a different category from weapons aswell


[9/19/2025 5:53 PM] s4mzy.
so its difficult to apply anything we find there that is depending on exact code to the knives


[9/19/2025 5:53 PM] flicqt
true, but this knife has 4 parts to it so I find it holding a lot of knowledge


[9/19/2025 5:54 PM] femmadi
so either u#A or u#C removes maliwan and makes it fire only

[9/19/2025 5:54 PM] femmadi
i think it was u#A


[9/19/2025 5:54 PM] s4mzy.
ahhh that tediore


[9/19/2025 5:55 PM] flicqt
very interesting


[9/19/2025 5:55 PM] s4mzy.
the others have been maliwan


[9/19/2025 5:55 PM] femmadi
doing three at a time and only changed one this time so it removed maliwan


[9/19/2025 5:55 PM] flicqt
:omegakekw:


[9/19/2025 5:55 PM] flicqt
I had a memory overflow with a change


[9/19/2025 5:55 PM] femmadi
yee, so vladof gun, with tediore and maliwan parts, but just really want to change tediore part


[9/19/2025 5:55 PM] flicqt
nvm it was a fluke


[9/19/2025 5:56 PM] s4mzy.
we also need more guns with those parts for reference


[9/19/2025 5:56 PM] s4mzy.
like Valdof gun with the same parts


[9/19/2025 5:57 PM] flicqt
ok I think I'm starting to understand this


[9/19/2025 5:57 PM] cr4nkst4r
I mean, the problem with most equipment it seems is they have checksum be like integrated.
If you just change the level for example, most of the time the whole item just breaks even tho the level part on it's own is right.
Same goes for some other stuff.


[9/19/2025 5:58 PM] femmadi
im trying out reversing the u#H for h#D to see if it goes to rad and shock


[9/19/2025 5:58 PM] femmadi
doubt it works like that but hey worth trying


[9/19/2025 5:58 PM] s4mzy.
yeah we saw this yesterday


[9/19/2025 5:58 PM] flicqt
```@Ugr$WBm/)}}$pj+I-U)itpw>roL#{/A`6KLd```

(KLd) first letter (K) has its own set of rules, second sections (L-d) are options inside that can dictate the firmware within those rules for that part so it looks like each part has a combination it can roll and the type of firmware it can roll with.

[9/19/2025 5:59 PM] itzrealeaze
uys i need help. I used this code ''@Uge8Cmm/)}}!ps8IK~<`SL9H~X6bE(kph_sz3xf)WsvS)f;R65'' but ingame its just not there, my existing item is just deleted 🙁


[9/19/2025 5:59 PM] flicqt
yes each part of the item has a rule to follow, starting when it was generated, those are static, the level and what parts can roll on it are also available depending on the level rule, which opens a pool, then that pool opens another pool each one having a rule to follow.

Seems like /(letter) might be related to rarity maybe A being the highest allows for more mods? D being lowest only puts 2 mods?

we did not discover how to make Legendaries


[9/19/2025 6:58 PM] s4mzy.
but the items code itself?


[9/19/2025 7:00 PM] flicqt
what was happening was it was throwing a fit with the save, so it acted like it was loading that save, but went back to 1.sav not 3.sav(my test save) so when I saw the legendary I was like wait wtf, reloaded the save the same way, even went to title menu and it showed it, the item its self was different though 1 sec


[9/19/2025 7:00 PM] s4mzy.
ahhhhh


[9/19/2025 7:00 PM] s4mzy.

[9/19/2025 7:13 PM] flicqt
Original code 
```@Ugr$WBm/)}}$pj+I-U)itpw>roL#{/B`6KAa```
New Code
```@Ugr$WBm/)}}$pj+I-U)itpw>roL#{/F`5KAa```
Originally changing /A to anything past /D would break the knife, and changing 6 to anything other than 6 would break the knife, how ever if you change /A to /F and reduce 6 to 5 the knife works again

bigger gun


[9/19/2025 8:21 PM] femmadi
And way less parts


[9/19/2025 8:21 PM] femmadi

to open this head to https://app.diagrams.net/ go to file ---> open from ---> Device, select this and it should open

I used this to keep track of all my item changes and their codes, graphed it in a flow on original to new code and its outcome 

Code is above the image, follow the arrows to follow the flow provided preview image as well

I'm trying my best. The amount of data to to coalesce into a usable format is rather daunting. Doesn't help that I'm barely following most of it. My brain sees hex codes like that and goes "uuuuhhhh wat?" I'm a web developer for a reason lol


[9/20/2025 1:34 AM] .thared
Maybe has something to do with what parts are on it? Like only some parts are available for certain level pools?


[9/20/2025 1:36 AM] flicqt
that was my original theory, Manufacturer, Type, Level, Rarity. Each section has a set of strict rules to follow, and they don't tend to bleed into each other, till I pulled a legendary Grenade Perk Juggler onto a purple Rarity so it's not entirely true to this

This mod increases crit chance and elemental chance. Author notes says it can sometimes change the name, which feels like it's changing the serial to me. Might be worth looking into:

odd ones out are ForgeKnight and the top row which seems to be just basic pickup items and quest item related.


[9/20/2025 3:26 AM] flicqt
I'll continue following the alphabet and this tree I am making, but it appears it covers all items eventually leading to its base which is WBm for Throwing Knife

[9/20/2025 3:28 AM] rockstvr710
no wonder throwing knives are op


[9/20/2025 3:29 AM] flicqt
So the very top level of this appears to be . @Ugr then a letter which falls into an item category which is lead by a structure symbol $ that I've seen range further into ! ? \ / ( { } etc, this letter no matter the manufacture or original item structure is completely nulled when the game reads an item is being created @Ug followed by some form of hierarchal logic ruling being the item type which is this Letter followed by the symbol mentioned before **$**


[9/20/2025 3:33 AM] turtlejuice__
I also have a similar kickballer. It's the only one I've found so far that is like that though.

[9/20/2025 3:33 AM] flicqt
So if you wanted to create an item you would realistically need @Ug (if its a player item then it needs a manufacturer or class tag placed here) followed by a Structure symbol related to this item, then the following letter to match the item Type so for an example if we wanted  a Gravitar item we would add K, L, M to start the base of the item, mesh and other data seems to be only relevant to /)}} *I could be wrong on this part*

okay... for those who are interested this is a ton of A-B Testing I went alphabetical at the start of the item generation... ```@Ugr$``` This line stays the same always the only edit I made was to the following Letter, the Base item Started with W followed by Bm I did not change anything after Bm so that remains static, the only letter change is before Bm so W-->A-->Z to show the changes to item generation and how strong the item type rule is.

* Go to https://app.diagrams.net/
* Click File and Open From Device, Use the Download to load the draw.io form I created to see the Data, feel free to post this in the googledoc or utilize this data for tests

I will branch off that tree and do A-B testing till it's automated


[9/20/2025 4:37 AM] flicqt
essentially I expect to create multiple new items eventually which will fully manually decode items in general.

yeah as basically what I am doing is finding the base line of items that is done, next is the first rule of the item I already broke some of those rules in the first few steps as a showcase in the graph outlined in green, and then I followed the structure starting with A which made the PowerBooster, now there are more boosters shield, health, ammo so those follow another generation prefix which I could of followed pre-A-Z Testing I'm sure. but yes after enough data following the current structure I'm emulating we can essentially build any item as long as we know the rules of that type.

from what I can tell the base of base items is listed in what I posted and then they are rules modified for those base items think of them as Templates that modify that template to create the items we see, SMG, Shotgun, AR, etc


[9/20/2025 4:46 AM] flicqt
but these Templates are the PURE defining rule set

[9/20/2025 8:21 AM] rockstvr710
i break guns to get copies to compare to sometimes too


[9/20/2025 8:21 AM] xkangoku
because if the gun is doing what its suppose to then im gonna guess either 1 it has sanity checks or 2 its completely backwards on that gun


[9/20/2025 8:21 AM] xkangoku
so what we learned would be reversed on it


[9/20/2025 8:21 AM] rockstvr710
but its prefixing is the same as all other maliwan smgs


[9/20/2025 8:22 AM] rockstvr710
so its prob 1 im ngl


[9/20/2025 8:22 AM] xkangoku

and ```@Ugg66CFme!K``` this is the Chuck gun
```/)43YDor%/YEly+i;``` these are the modifiers
```>J-o^RG``` this determins if the gun that have the modifiers exist or not

:rooComfies1:

it alw results in level 50 broken


[9/20/2025 10:39 AM] rockstvr710
😔 its got its own checks or somethn


[9/20/2025 10:40 AM] xkangoku
its too powerful


[9/20/2025 10:40 AM] rockstvr710

[9/20/2025 10:40 AM] rockstvr710
literally


[9/20/2025 10:40 AM] rockstvr710
its highest lvl 1 dps gun


[9/20/2025 10:40 AM] rockstvr710
😭


[9/20/2025 10:40 AM] rockstvr710
and dps and dmg scale to level


[9/20/2025 10:40 AM] rockstvr710
as we learned with the one level 99 forced dropped sniper that had almost 600k dmg


[9/20/2025 10:40 AM] xkangoku
would mean


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] xkangoku
it makes other guns cry


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] rockstvr710
yes


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] xkangoku
so


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] xkangoku
we need it


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] rockstvr710
if it was level 50 itd be the best smg

[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] xkangoku
so


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] rockstvr710
but whenever we change the level chunk to level 50


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] xkangoku
we break into gbx


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] rockstvr710
it dies


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] xkangoku
and steal the source code


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] rockstvr710
but it worked on all the other preorder stuff


[9/20/2025 10:41 AM] rockstvr710
makes sense right>?


[9/20/2025 10:42 AM] xkangoku

but still takes a bit
have to add some features like a database "writer" , serial builder , serial analyzer , 
thought about ocr integration for easier database entries but OCR makes my head :kleeexplosion:

[9/20/2025 11:34 AM] rockstvr710
im wondering if its possible to make something that hooks to the game to edit weapons or atleast uses the games files to display them in an editor


[9/20/2025 11:35 AM] rockstvr710
seeing them before we re encode would help to not make broken guns i feel like no?


[9/20/2025 11:35 AM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
wym? RT weapon editing?


[9/20/2025 11:35 AM] rockstvr710
like the actual models


[9/20/2025 11:35 AM] rockstvr710
of the serials


[9/20/2025 11:35 AM] rockstvr710
like yk how the one editor thing works


[9/20/2025 11:35 AM] rockstvr710
shows all the raw data


[9/20/2025 11:35 AM] rockstvr710
if it showed like the model too


[9/20/2025 11:35 AM] rockstvr710
itd be easier to use i feel like


[9/20/2025 11:35 AM] rockstvr710
and guess and check


[9/20/2025 11:35 AM] rockstvr710
bc broken guns are always handles and missing parts


[9/20/2025 11:36 AM] rockstvr710
and it seems parts are tied to all the values of the guns aswell


[9/20/2025 11:36 AM] rockstvr710
but idk i might just be schizo


[9/20/2025 11:36 AM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
xD


[9/20/2025 11:38 AM] rockstvr710
also i think half the reason is bc i keep seeing these

so far the only thing I have found yall haven't said (or at least I haven't seen) is the tail bytes are the equip slot

{Reactions}
❤️

[9/20/2025 12:49 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
if u change the slot the serial doesnt change


[9/20/2025 1:53 PM] soldier9322
when i add items in my yaml file into a empty slot it mostly gets corrupted.. anything else i need to know why this happens?


[9/20/2025 1:54 PM] soldier9322
some codes are working, but most of them will break the item or never show in bagpack


[9/20/2025 1:57 PM] soldier9322
when i check the serial with ce its in my backpack in the first slot, in my save its in slot_8, what the fuck?


[9/20/2025 2:05 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
if the serial is a "broken" one it ends unknown
if its a "unfinished" one it shows NaN


[9/20/2025 2:06 PM] soldier9322
yeah but i mostly add normal dropped items


[9/20/2025 2:06 PM] soldier9322
most of the modded ones are broken anyway for me, so i just keep the normal ones for now


[9/20/2025 2:07 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
than it should work
sure u add em correctly?


[9/20/2025 2:07 PM] soldier9322
i think so.. this is a enhancement from item codes: @Ug!pHG2}TYgOymuEhq_eX)ChyxV^ARtDz8D^IjFh^RXZ9KIRF


[9/20/2025 2:07 PM] soldier9322
if i add with ce -> gone, adding on a empty backpack slot -> not there


[9/20/2025 2:08 PM] soldier9322
maybe state flags or flags are different idk..


[9/20/2025 2:09 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
if u add into an empty slot
make sure u dont have "flags" in it only state_flags


[9/20/2025 2:10 PM] soldier9322
and state 1 or 3 ?


[9/20/2025 2:10 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
depends


[9/20/2025 2:10 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
1 is normal


[9/20/2025 2:10 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
3 is favorite


[9/20/2025 2:10 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
its just how its marked


[9/20/2025 2:10 PM] cr4nkst4r
517 is trash I suppose


[9/20/2025 2:10 PM] soldier9322
ah and it does not fck up when i use 3 instead of 1 because tthe serial changes when marked


[9/20/2025 2:11 PM] soldier9322
when i mark as favorite my serial is changing


[9/20/2025 2:11 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
serial doesnt change if its marked


[9/20/2025 2:11 PM] cr4nkst4r
but flags and state_flags are fine tho, flags is just telling the game it can find the same item as equipped


[9/20/2025 2:11 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
dont copy flags


[9/20/2025 2:11 PM] soldier9322
okay, when i add it to backpack, just state_flag: 1 and serial

{Reactions}
👍

[9/20/2025 2:11 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
if u really want to use flags u have to copy the entry into equiped


[9/20/2025 2:12 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
yes


[9/20/2025 2:13 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
the thing i recognized is if u change an existing item in CE it will bug i guess positive or negative

[9/20/2025 2:15 PM] soldier9322
item is different -.-


[9/20/2025 2:15 PM] soldier9322
or maybe the code is fucked up and the guy copied the wrong one


[9/20/2025 2:15 PM] cr4nkst4r
usually, as long as you have this slot unlocked, it should be fine tho


[9/20/2025 2:15 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
if u add it this way it is the real item


[9/20/2025 2:15 PM] soldier9322
yeah its a correct item, not the item he posted xD


[9/20/2025 2:15 PM] soldier9322
so i thought i fckd up


[9/20/2025 2:16 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
not ur fault


[9/20/2025 2:16 PM] soldier9322

Same at least for grenades, only samples I take currently. Since all differ focusing on one type is better. But Plan on adding the others too xD

I feel like there may be some inconsistencies between ce edit of yaml and raw command prompt edits as people are having trouble with my string code that I posted


[9/20/2025 7:25 PM] rabiddementia
Seems to be little inconsistencies between the two. Like the item they get is something that is missing at least one attribute. That’s just what I have noticed


[9/20/2025 7:30 PM] xanmple
do you edit from the yaml @ЯΛBID ?


[9/20/2025 7:32 PM] rabiddementia
Yes directly inside, no ce or any editors. I use the raw source code


[9/20/2025 7:33 PM] rabiddementia
@xanmple


[9/20/2025 7:34 PM] hobamj

[9/20/2025 7:34 PM] rabiddementia
So that may be why there is inconsistencies when entering string codes in


[9/20/2025 7:36 PM] hobamj
yeah when i was editing my first class mod i was getting the same prob he was so i just said fuck it the convivence wasnt worth the headache

[9/20/2025 7:37 PM] hobamj
you can do pretty fast editing if you play in border mods and just have everything pulled up so not to much slower

{Reactions}
👍

[9/20/2025 7:38 PM] rabiddementia
It’s not much harder, I have a text document with all my shortcuts saved to it for when I need to open it back up


[9/20/2025 7:43 PM] xanmple
what do you use to edit yaml @ЯΛBID I’ll give it a try instead


[9/20/2025 7:47 PM] rabiddementia
@xanmple I use the bl4 crypt from nexus, the original run through


[9/20/2025 7:47 PM] rabiddementia
Just the decrypt and reencrypt the file, no save editor or weapon id changers


[9/20/2025 7:48 PM] rabiddementia
Xpandaku posted a good tutorial somewhere on nexus if you need the complete runthrough


[9/20/2025 8:36 PM] cr4nkst4r
@Maple Found a use case for these?

[9/21/2025 1:14 AM] soldier9322
maybe the code generation in editor is broke


[9/21/2025 1:16 AM] rockstvr710
which


[9/21/2025 1:17 AM] soldier9322

i've been working on a encoder that can read raw edits . why ive been so silent. still a ways to go but... we will get there.


[9/21/2025 1:19 AM] rockstvr710
the encoding of theirs works i think bc it returns valid items still its just we dk what is really what


[9/21/2025 1:20 AM] rockstvr710
it worked technically to change levels of the preorder smg but


[9/21/2025 1:20 AM] rockstvr710
anytime anyone tries to edit it it breaks


[9/21/2025 1:20 AM] rockstvr710
likely due to it being signed bc its preorder / deluxe bonus


[9/21/2025 1:21 AM] rockstvr710
manually i couldnt get preorder smg to work either


[9/21/2025 1:21 AM] rockstvr710
the other preorder items worked fine tho


[9/21/2025 1:21 AM] rockstvr710
compared raw data of level 50 plasmacoil for the level numbers got level 50 ani

🔒 Technical Discoveries
Block System

Each block encodes B bytes → Lc Base85 chars.

Corpus showed these are consistent: (1→1), (2→2), (5→4), (6→5), (7→6), (25→20), etc.

Some unused blocks auto-quarantined: (15,12), (16,13), (20,16), (146,120).

Forced Splits

Special remainder cases require manual tiling.

Example: rem=37 → split into (25,20,mid) + (5,4,tail).

Needed to maintain canonical layout across corpus.

Prefs System

JSON-based preference table (true_blocks.json).

Determines which (L,B) form to use when multiple are valid.

Survives reloads correctly.

Quarantine

Blocks that never occur in corpus are quarantined.

Keeps search space clean.

if the change you're trying to make dosnt line up with whats accpeted by bl4 engine it wont matter. this could be 100% accurate. but changing also needs additional changes to tail and back section unless its an independant value like rarity or element*somecases* etc

i think it may be the reason it works while broken tho

bc nothing else does dmg broken


[9/21/2025 5:53 AM] rockstvr710

the mirv makes it guarenteed dmg

and the nuke makes it viable

true

if we can get a mirv nuke homing we might be able

these types of merges are really easy as @akamoden said


[9/21/2025 5:55 AM] rockstvr710

what just gotta have a shit load of serial numbers?

not with grenades repkits n shields


[9/21/2025 5:55 AM] rockstvr710
thats why their easy


[9/21/2025 5:55 AM] rockstvr710
u kinda can just take the base

and mash it to diff perks


[9/21/2025 5:56 AM] openrome

looking at modded items i have deducted that firmware lives at the end of equipment. i mean we knew this. but goo news i have the bit mapper so once i feed it every type of firmware i can then share the bits for them and yall can add on whatever firmware yall like.

[9/21/2025 9:34 AM] rockstvr710
Sometimes it is


[9/21/2025 9:34 AM] rockstvr710



[9/21/2025 9:35 AM] rockstvr710
like when i got to this


[9/21/2025 9:35 AM] rockstvr710
if u change % to ) it becomes a diff firmware


[9/21/2025 9:35 AM] rockstvr710
but retains rest of serial


[9/21/2025 9:35 AM] rockstvr710
= is what i used to courrupt the firmware off to get the blank if i remember right


[9/21/2025 9:36 AM] akamoden
OO!! OO !! i did it!

👀

[9/21/2025 9:36 AM] akamoden
yes the byte for firmware is 21!!!


[9/21/2025 9:36 AM] akamoden
Byte[21] --- → 3


[9/21/2025 9:36 AM] akamoden
in that specific item anyways...


[9/21/2025 9:36 AM] akamoden
its a 1:1 byte


[9/21/2025 9:37 AM] akamoden
or i mean 1, 1 byte


[9/21/2025 9:37 AM] rockstvr710
so 1 character = change


[9/21/2025 9:37 AM] rockstvr710
lucky serial


[9/21/2025 9:37 AM] akamoden

[9/21/2025 9:37 AM] akamoden

[9/21/2025 9:37 AM] rockstvr710
woah


[9/21/2025 9:37 AM] rockstvr710
low float in csgo moment?


[9/21/2025 9:37 AM] akamoden
some bytes change whole segments tho.

👍

[9/21/2025 9:38 AM] rockstvr710
but when u do that with firmware in this case atleast it just fallbacks to By / blank


[9/21/2025 9:39 AM] rockstvr710
like if u guess the symbol wrong ig


[9/21/2025 9:39 AM] rockstvr710

[9/21/2025 10:00 AM] flicqt
So some of the data I found translates to all items basically it just depends on their bit length

sooo which of these do we think makes bundled dupe


[9/21/2025 10:02 AM] flicqt
Appears it's very gear dependant but we have a min and max for the bits so we could.. Create a new item. The issue is each type has a set of rules. Has anyone seen a pattern while crafting what rules break the item? We need to keep track of that.

working on a true encoder so we can make edits that are valid to min max items. i have another encoder that ignores this and tries its best to make the game accpect illegal items.

[9/21/2025 12:02 PM] flicqt
can you add amp + enrage


[9/21/2025 12:02 PM] flicqt
let me see if I can find an enrage


[9/21/2025 12:05 PM] rockstvr710
moreso i think i just found a way to add charges to the epic 2 perks


[9/21/2025 12:05 PM] rockstvr710
so id need a amp+enrage


[9/21/2025 12:05 PM] rockstvr710
to do tht


[9/21/2025 12:05 PM] rockstvr710
i used the front half of mega tripple bypass


[9/21/2025 12:06 PM] rockstvr710
and added the perk string of the epic one in #deleted-channel


[9/21/2025 12:06 PM] flicqt
yeah except I've never found an amp+enrage, I assume it's possible but insanely rare


[9/21/2025 12:06 PM] rockstvr710
perkstrings kinda are premade


[9/21/2025 12:06 PM] rockstvr710
you cant really add to it without changing the whole thing


[9/21/2025 12:07 PM] rockstvr710
from my tinkering atleast

and @akamoden s brain


[9/21/2025 12:07 PM] rockstvr710
and what i can phathom of it


[9/21/2025 12:07 PM] rockstvr710
some things like firmware can be easy changes


[9/21/2025 12:07 PM] rockstvr710
or some things can be easy changes for some things


[9/21/2025 12:08 PM] rockstvr710
but not other things even if same item


[9/21/2025 12:08 PM] rockstvr710
bc their serials are built diff


[9/21/2025 12:08 PM] flicqt
yeah I realize you'd have to build the repkit from scratch I thought you where somewhat doing that already :KEK: but now I see you're splicing data together

ok then what is @Ugr$xKm/)}}!tDN_Mi}RPG}@$^KoV#G

To determine what number the string "@Ugr
$xKm/)}}!tDN_Mi}RPG}@$^KoV#G" corresponds to, we will apply the encoding scheme established in the previous queries. The rule is that the decimal value is calculated as the length of the variable portion of the string multiplied by 2.25, minus 9.5, with the result rounded to the nearest integer and converted to hexadecimal. The strings have a 12-character prefix that does not contribute to the encoded value.Step-by-Step Analysis:Identify the Prefix and Variable Portion:The string is "@Ugr
$xKm/)}}!tDN_Mi}RPG}@$^KoV#G" (32 characters).
Assume a 12-character prefix, consistent with previous examples (e.g., "@Ugr
%Scm/)}}!", "@Ug
!pHG2}TZ*", "@Ugr
$xKm/)}}!").
Prefix: "@Ugr
$xKm/)}}!" (12 characters).
Variable portion: "tDN_Mi}RPG}@$^KoV#G" (20 characters).

Apply the Encoding Rule:The formula is: Decimal value = (length of variable portion × 2.25) - 9.5, rounded to the nearest integer.
Length of variable portion = 20.
Calculate: 20×2.25=4520 \times 2.25 = 4520 \times 2.25 = 45
.
Subtract 9.5: 45−9.5=35.545 - 9.5 = 35.545 - 9.5 = 35.5
.
Round 35.5 to the nearest integer: 35.5 is equidistant from 35 and 36, but following standard rounding (round up for .5), we use 36.
Convert 36 to hexadecimal: 36÷16=2 remainder 436 \div 16 = 2 \text{ remainder } 436 \div 16 = 2 \text{ remainder } 4
, so 36 = "24" (hexadecimal).

Verify Consistency with Previous Examples:Previous examples:"@Ugr
%Scm/)}}!pv@<M>VQ_G&e+!)By" (variable portion: 18 characters) → 18×2.25−9.5=40.5−9.5=3118 \times 2.25 - 9.5 = 40.5 - 9.5 = 3118 \times 2.25 - 9.5 = 40.5 - 9.5 = 31

/)}$pj+Ir45SIpw>roLwX1&DF6" (variable portion: 22 characters) → 22×2.25−9.5=49.5−9.5=4022 \times 2.25 - 9.5 = 49.5 - 9.5 = 4022 \times 2.25 - 9.5 = 49.5 - 9.5 = 40
 → "28" (hexadecimal).

Current string: 20×2.25−9.5=35.5≈3620 \times 2.25 - 9.5 = 35.5 \approx 3620 \times 2.25 - 9.5 = 35.5 \approx 36
 → "24" (hexadecimal).
The formula is consistent, with rounding applied when the result is non-integer (e.g., 42.25 → 42, 35.5 → 36).

Consider Rounding and Alternative Adjustments:The result 35.5 is equidistant from 35 and 36. Rounding to 36 follows standard convention (round up for .5), but let's test rounding to 35:Convert 35 to hexadecimal: 35÷16=2 remainder 335 \div 16 = 2 \text{ remainder } 335 \div 16 = 2 \text{ remainder } 3
, so 35 = "23" (hexadecimal).

Since previous non-integer results (e.g., 42.25 → 42) rounded to the nearest integer, and 35.5 rounds up to 36, we use 36 ("24") as the primary result. If rounding down to 35 ("23") were intended, it would deviate from standard rounding but could be tested with more context.

Final Verification:The prefix "@Ugr
$xKm/)}}!" (12 characters) matches the pattern of previous prefixes.
The formula with rounding to 36 produces a clean hexadecimal result ("24").
The consistency of the formula across all examples supports this result.

Final AnswerFor the string "@Ugr
$xKm/)}}!tDN_Mi}RPG}@$^KoV#G", the corresponding number is:24

working on it as we speak. i was just asking people preference cause figuring out how GBX encodes Bytes if driving me up the wall... i mean its not that bad but its alot of work. that im happy doing. i just was wondering if we are okay with free handing, or the general consensus...

[9/21/2025 9:17 PM] akamoden
ill try to get this done as fast as i can so we can edit items with bytes then. currently i can see what bytes do what, compare two items in bytes, but sometimes bytes use more than one base85 symbol to represent a single byte. so ineed tyo reverse how the encoder decides that.

Merging similar items and calculating part length


[9/21/2025 10:30 PM] rockstvr710
Yeah but the bytes be diff for the end half of the serials

wym?


[9/21/2025 10:31 PM] rockstvr710
I think is bc there really might be 2 types of encoding

Was a schizo thought before


[9/21/2025 10:31 PM] rockstvr710
But idk anymore


[9/21/2025 10:31 PM] rockstvr710
Bc common seperators for items include ! And $ cant be merged interchangeably unless the same separator


[9/21/2025 10:32 PM] rockstvr710
But the same items some will have ! And some will have $ even if same roll just different drops


[9/21/2025 10:32 PM] rockstvr710
Which is what leads me to believe theres 2 types of encoding going on

yeah i see why you're confused its okay and ill keep cracking on my end. it just simply dosnt work that way

no i know its super counter intuitive.


[9/21/2025 10:41 PM] akamoden
so you know how i posted the one comparision that showed bytes 21 were the same although the serial looked different... like % was byte 21.. and its value was 3 and then we looked at another item that had the exact same byte 21 = 3 but the base85 symbols were more than 1 symbol so instead of % it was AB

i just try snapping it to mega tripple like everything else but it no work


[9/22/2025 12:35 AM] akamoden
what charges?


[9/22/2025 12:35 AM] akamoden
could you explain a little more


[9/22/2025 12:36 AM] rockstvr710
so the repkits of that family


[9/22/2025 12:36 AM] rockstvr710
have a charge system


[9/22/2025 12:36 AM] rockstvr710
and max of 2 perks


[9/22/2025 12:36 AM] rockstvr710
the charge is in base tho


[9/22/2025 12:36 AM] rockstvr710
so if u merge a 2perk epic


[9/22/2025 12:36 AM] rockstvr710
u get a 3perk op repkit


[9/22/2025 12:36 AM] rockstvr710
$pj*dr3FgVqs~WzO{j?;fhGw6 from a different epic repkit for leech amp


[9/22/2025 12:37 AM] akamoden
but you want it on a legendary?


[9/22/2025 12:37 AM] rockstvr710
or purple


[9/22/2025 12:38 AM] rockstvr710
it changes to purple any other time


[9/22/2025 12:38 AM] rockstvr710
so iassume that rarirty in perk string too


[9/22/2025 12:38 AM] rockstvr710
which is why this weird to me


[9/22/2025 12:38 AM] rockstvr710
might be bc the $ chunk on that family means green rarirty where as the one it came from it means epic?


[9/22/2025 12:38 AM] rockstvr710
im schizo


[9/22/2025 12:40 AM] akamoden
yeah but epic might have its own rules it has to follow. grab a epic rep kit of the same family vladov etc etc paste both codes here


[9/22/2025 12:41 AM] rockstvr710
So i lost the front end


[9/22/2025 12:41 AM] rockstvr710

I need its base😔


[9/22/2025 12:43 AM] akamoden
yeah leech seems to be allowed as a secondary perk for epics. you'll need rearrange code for it to work. perk placment means alot.


[9/22/2025 12:43 AM] akamoden
like for thatone amp might be the dominating perk. where on the other one leech is


[9/22/2025 12:47 AM] akamoden
im really close on my encoder... just a few stubborn rules.

we will soon be able to change btye for byte!


[9/22/2025 12:54 AM] akamoden
im gonna upload my byte tracker later after its finish and i figure before i post it on nexus, we will need to collect what byte does what... for example byte 21 on sheilds or gernades or whatever it was is for the fimeware


[9/22/2025 1:03 AM] flicqt
Actually that one is odd because the Name of the Item suggest Leech to be the dominating perk


[9/22/2025 1:04 AM] rockstvr710
still find it hilarious u can pet the modded shotgun @Maple 😭

[9/22/2025 1:06 AM] akamoden
correct. this is a good observation. however placment in the item is lower, and since serials and bytes follow a linear path, it would be a change near the end or end of the middle chunk. not much of a difference but a sublte one.

the skins also change the serials to be phos when shared

There is one thing that may help everyone. Nexus has a mod: Gun Editor, which can view some data of a gun, but I am not sure what it corresponds to. If this is useful, why not directly compare these data? This way, you can directly use them to modify the required gun

thats how youd find the damage output of it atleast / the byte its in so kinda yeah


[9/22/2025 1:31 AM] rockstvr710
but theyd have to be the exact same

[9/22/2025 1:34 AM] rockstvr710
depends on item type


[9/22/2025 1:34 AM] rockstvr710
Aka released a nice tip of shields repkits and ordnances have less checks than guns


[9/22/2025 1:35 AM] rockstvr710
so those u really can kinda just swap the perks around on


[9/22/2025 1:35 AM] rockstvr710
but only the whole perk string


[9/22/2025 1:35 AM] rockstvr710
not indiviual perks


[9/22/2025 1:35 AM] akamoden
because guns are tied to their actual parts. like barrel == pellet count


[9/22/2025 1:35 AM] akamoden
but sheilds are just cosmetic items


[9/22/2025 1:35 AM] rockstvr710
only tip for those items too


[9/22/2025 1:35 AM] rockstvr710
try to keep the $'s together


[9/22/2025 1:35 AM] rockstvr710

no acutal parts related to them

Can I even use the preorder stuff even if I didn't preorder? Cause it doesn't let me equip them


[9/22/2025 1:40 AM] rockstvr710

[9/22/2025 1:40 AM] openrome

[9/22/2025 1:41 AM] rockstvr710
the preorder items signed so ppl who no preorder or buy the highest version of the game cant use them


[9/22/2025 1:41 AM] rockstvr710

yea its the only weapon i use


[9/22/2025 2:45 AM] anoeticx
Longshot here, if we hook ProcessEvent in the game when a gun is generated/spawned/whatever and inspect it at that point to get the method/function that generates the serials?


[9/22/2025 2:45 AM] anoeticx
Since the game has no anti cheat it shouldn't be a problem


[9/22/2025 2:45 AM] rockstvr710
i use mirv minefields

so knifes work about the same as other items, you find a base with the same byte rule set and then slap parts on it, but you can adjust those parts piece by piece if you change certain parts of the code, the length is all that matters in the end that needs to remain the same.

and this ? possible ?


[9/22/2025 6:02 AM] flicqt
I think it's locking cause I am literally putting the firmware on the item and not changing the rest of the item


[9/22/2025 6:02 AM] flicqt
which I think is how the firmware machine must work

[9/22/2025 6:03 AM] rockstvr710

How much have you guys figured out in terms of swapping bonuses on these items anyhow?


[9/22/2025 10:10 AM] rockstvr710
it works


[9/22/2025 10:10 AM] rockstvr710

[9/22/2025 10:10 AM] qunai
Like, do you know what you're swapping or is it still a guessing game?

But in theory should be 1:1


[9/22/2025 10:47 AM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
the problem is if u decode it change bits and reencode it the game doesnt know what to do with the changed bits/symbols

Wait what? You only have to have the shield equipped and you get all those gun stats?

so u can have bundle stats


[9/22/2025 10:49 AM] akamoden
This doesn't just re encode new bytes. Or changes in any old way. It knows that certain bytes change more than one base85 symbol.


[9/22/2025 10:51 AM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
so u can decrypt it in all parts?

[9/22/2025 10:51 AM] rockstvr710
?


[9/22/2025 10:51 AM] rockstvr710
bc firmware sometimes is 1 symbol


[9/22/2025 10:51 AM] rockstvr710
but not others


[9/22/2025 10:51 AM] akamoden
For instance. Bytes 21 controls the firmware one two separate items yet one item 1 its represented at % and item two its represented as "ABC" or something. And my encoder knows that.


[9/22/2025 10:52 AM] rockstvr710
also the one we found on the shield i think is unreleased til either holloween event or bountypack 1

Nothing is encrypted. The serial represent bytes and the problem is understanding how gearbox re encodes those using their custom base85 symbols.

[9/22/2025 10:54 AM] akamoden
Yeah basically


[9/22/2025 10:55 AM] akamoden
I just need to test it live. I've been using the 10k items serial and running it over and over. I have 100% matches etc. But now its time to verify for any final tweaks.


[9/22/2025 10:56 AM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
would be easier if u use detailed serials i guess

isnt there any items database we can unpack and see ? would be easier to add all items from a vendor to inventory and check which perks we need

or put into a tool which reads the perks


[9/22/2025 11:12 AM] soldier9322
e.g. all VLADOF enhancements -> import in tool which reads all stats/perks-> check stats -> add items you want to bagpack

what determines the quality of the effects on an item? e.g. 5% chance siphon, 10%, 25%, etc.?


[9/22/2025 11:25 AM] rockstvr710
itd need both

theres no indiviualizing perks as of right now


[9/22/2025 11:26 AM] rockstvr710
u kinda can snap perks off of things and snap them on to *Some* other things


[9/22/2025 11:26 AM] twelve.vcf
would it be possible for you to put the 25% siphon on a watts 4 dinner, perhaps, even if I'm not the one that asked?

Fme!K / }TY* = family/rarity “bundle” marker
 This corresponds to the level of the weapon 
“Fme!K” - lvl 50 for Shotguns, Pistols. 
“}TY*” - lvl 50 for SMGs, Assault Rifles, Snipers.
were you using }TY* ?

The v2.5 will still be trial and error, yes where you will have to modify values yourself to wtv values and just keep trying until one work HOWEVER it will also include stuff that will actually help you understand what to do, for ex: the thing that rock used to do the kinky kitty legendary thing and it will also be encoding 100% right with no issues or anything from the encoding back


[9/23/2025 7:35 AM] lshift
The devs won't allow the AI to do so

However with the 3.0 it will be a diff situation


[9/23/2025 7:37 AM] awsam.
And I believe rock already sent a pic of what the 3.0 would kind of look like.

[9/23/2025 8:44 AM] s4mzy.
It just seemed to have spat out random item ids that wouldn't work at the start so I just went onto messing around with thr code


[9/23/2025 8:45 AM] rockstvr710
doesnt do this anymore


[9/23/2025 8:45 AM] rockstvr710
that was bc he built it going off of the one dudes save thing

Is there any features of it not working?


[9/23/2025 8:46 AM] rockstvr710
raw data doesnt save on the current tho


[9/23/2025 8:46 AM] rockstvr710
the current public doesnt save raw


[9/23/2025 8:46 AM] rockstvr710
but u can see most of it


[9/23/2025 8:47 AM] rockstvr710
Id j wait for update tbh


[9/23/2025 8:47 AM] rockstvr710
Not when it updates


[9/23/2025 8:47 AM] rockstvr710
But rn yeah


[9/23/2025 8:47 AM] s4mzy.
Well I'll mess around with it once the version is out fully


[9/23/2025 8:47 AM] rockstvr710
My copy is just a bit more updated


[9/23/2025 8:47 AM] rockstvr710
Im the test dummy


[9/23/2025 8:47 AM] rockstvr710

[9/23/2025 8:47 AM] s4mzy.
<3


[9/23/2025 8:48 AM] s4mzy.
But your version has let you change the lvl?


[9/23/2025 8:48 AM] s4mzy.
Have you changed anything else


[9/23/2025 8:49 AM] rockstvr710
with the help of editor i change level n rarity


[9/23/2025 8:49 AM] rockstvr710
bc its hard to find rarity on some items


[9/23/2025 8:49 AM] rockstvr710
rest of it is gun sex and pray


[9/23/2025 8:51 AM] s4mzy.
Well lvl is easy to find but the fact it changes depended on the lvl you want means you need to find it for 50 lvls


[9/23/2025 8:51 AM] s4mzy.
So u need 100 weapons atleast to check them


[9/23/2025 8:52 AM] s4mzy.
Then class mods and grenades


[9/23/2025 8:52 AM] rockstvr710
nah


[9/23/2025 8:52 AM] rockstvr710
u can find the begining of the part string


[9/23/2025 8:52 AM] rockstvr710
and just update the level part


[9/23/2025 8:52 AM] rockstvr710
i no longer need 2 of the same item for ts


[9/23/2025 8:52 AM] rockstvr710

thats not how cheating works for 99% of people?


[9/23/2025 8:55 AM] s4mzy.
I mean I cheated in lvl 50 stuff to just put them in my bank while I play legit


[9/23/2025 8:56 AM] s4mzy.
But the thing is if you give people a lvl editor then it should have 1-50 in there


[9/23/2025 8:57 AM] rockstvr710
adding things wasnt out when i played thru legit 😔


[9/23/2025 8:58 AM] s4mzy.

So I just joined the discord and skimming through pins.  Is there anything major on progress being made to decipher the serial hash?  I've spent most of my time working on stockpiles of similar items and can loosely edit the serial strings.


[9/23/2025 9:07 PM] sairouth
Thats roughly where most people are


[9/23/2025 9:07 PM] sairouth
At least the ones working on it


[9/23/2025 9:10 PM] itsanotter
Gotcha.  I get valid results about 90% of the time but I can't target the outcome so it's not very useful atm


[9/23/2025 9:22 PM] s4mzy.
we have come to a good understanding of each where the information for items are held


[9/23/2025 9:22 PM] s4mzy.
such as stats, firmwares, brands and lvls


[9/23/2025 9:22 PM] s4mzy.
and of course there is alot of other stats/ firmware/ levels we cant just pick and choose what we are wanting on there atm


[9/23/2025 9:23 PM] itsanotter
Gotcha, so this is still mostly accurate:  https://discord.com/channels/1306526445090111508/1418368877183893715/1419463468905660416

havent seen one go over 7 atleast

yea and the substats is what i was wantong to see if i can change


[9/23/2025 9:57 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
the safest way is to compare the actually the same item just 5 and 2 changed


[9/23/2025 9:59 PM] thedarkness1404
what you mean ?


[9/23/2025 10:00 PM] s4mzy.
i got another example for you i think


[9/23/2025 10:00 PM] s4mzy.
you are basically gonna cross reference the two items


[9/23/2025 10:00 PM] s4mzy.
and see what changes


[9/23/2025 10:00 PM] s4mzy.
so then you can isolate the values of the perks


[9/23/2025 10:00 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
if u want to find out which part is which u have to compare similar items like only 1 bonus / stat changed

[9/23/2025 10:06 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p
@sam. ordnance/shield/mod level 26 part seems to be m/%1u!


[9/23/2025 10:07 PM] s4mzy.

smgs and assualt rifles and snipers all share the same lvl code it seems


[9/23/2025 10:08 PM] s4mzy.
then pistols and shotguns are the same too


[9/23/2025 10:09 PM] s4mzy.
so we would need 100 weapons then another 100 to reference them to


[9/23/2025 10:09 PM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p

```Original Codes

@Ug!pHG2}TYgT$&EGLuIO$LG3oE+^Jj#b<3b?8&vIR;7ASt
→ Spawned as One-Shot Undead Eye with +4 / +3 skills and +40% Kinetic Damage + Sniper Rifle Damage.

@Ug!pHG2}TYgTq+H<LuD#=s+U3CGN/1KmFu8xA5sV;7G_U00`
→ Spawned as One-Shot Undead Eye with +5 / +2 skills and +10% Melee Crit Chance + Sniper Rifle Damage, Rubberband Man firmware.

🔎 Hybrid Attempts

@Ug!pHG2}TYgT$&EGLuIO$LG3oE+^Jj#b<3b?8&vIR;7G_U00
→ Item deleted / did not spawn (bad splice).

Variants (window swaps near suffix)

Variant A: @Ug!pHG2}TYgTq+H<LuD#=s+U3CGN/1Kb<3b?8&vIR;7G_U00
→ Spawned as Resilient Undead Eye with +3 / +4 skills and +10% Melee.

Variant B: @Ug!pHG2}TYgTq+H<LuD#=s+U3CGN/1KmF3b?8&vIR;7G_U00
→ Spawned as Resilient Undead Eye with +4 / +2 skills and +10% Melee.

Variant C: @Ug!pHG2}TYgTq+H<LuD#=s+U3CGN/j#b<3b?8&vIR;7G_U00
→ Spawned as Resilient Undead Eye with +2 / +3 skills and +10% Melee.

Fine-grained Substitution (indices 22–28 & 18–21)

All produced item didn’t spawn (invalid code)

Except one hybrid (last test):

@Ug!pHG2}TYgT$&EGLuD#=s+U3CGN/1KmFu8xA5sV;7G_U00
→ Spawned as 5+2 Undead Eye but still +10% Melee Crit Chance.

Stat Suffix Swap (success!)

@Ug!pHG2}TYgTq+H<LuD#=s+U3CGN/1KmFu8xA5sV;7AS_U00
→ Did not spawn.

@Ug!pHG2}TYgTq+H<LuD#=s+U3CGN/1KmFu8xA5`sV;7AStU00
→ Success: One-Shot Undead Eye with +5 / +2 skills, +40% Kinetic Damage + Sniper Rifle Damage.

@Ug!pHG2}TYs%ybioaH%xZ4wb3gsa^(k%b<1}RIY=%eNeTdfg?Gj695
→ Used in game firmware machine to add "lifeblood"```



🔹 __Skill Value Experiments__

@Ug!pHG2}TYgTq+H<LuD#=s+U3CGN/1KmFu8xA5`sV;7AStU00

F region test (boost slot around “1KmF”)

…1KmGu… → Spawned 3+2, still with Kinetic+Sniper → confirmed this block = skill distribution.

…1Km6u… → Spawned 5+2 but lost stats → confirmed stats are separate.

🔎__Alphabet sweep (H–M)__

H, I, J → Didn’t spawn → invalid encodings.

K → Spawned as 3 boosted skills (2 + 2 + 1), but stats wiped.

L → Spawned as 3 boosted skills (2 + 2 + 1), different skill set, stats wiped.

M → Didn’t spawn.

(letters N, O, P, Q, R, S) → Could possibly give you 4 different boosted skills.

🔎 __What We Learned__

The skill boosts are controlled by a symbol in the …1KmF… block.

F = 5+2 distribution.

K/L = 3-skill distributions (2+2+1).

The stats live in a different encoded section (;7ASt, ;7G_, etc.).

__We now know it’s possible to:__

Force different skill distributions (2 skills, 3 skills, potentially 4).

Force different stat rolls via the suffix.

original item with 50% mag size + 50 %crit weapon damage
```@Uge98>m/)}}!f5WGM7=L3=um}vA5Ao&D**r```

isolated: ```vA5Ao``` < this is mag size 50%


[9/24/2025 8:12 AM] soldier9322
item with 50% gun crit dmg and 100% gun equip speed
```@Uge98>m/)}}!ti>aM7=L3=um}vA5AQwD**r```


[9/24/2025 8:13 AM] soldier9322
looks like stat 2 is first in the code, and stat 1 is the last one


[9/24/2025 8:14 AM] soldier9322
usually i would say ```wD**r``` is 50 % gun crit.. but do not work


[9/24/2025 8:30 AM] hobamj
cant individualize parts yet best bet is to get a piece of gear with the stats you want then trafer both over


[9/24/2025 8:34 AM] soldier9322
yeah i got many hero of bullets.. but all with different perks


[9/24/2025 8:34 AM] soldier9322
or do you mean stats correct but transfer the name/vendor?


[9/24/2025 8:35 AM] p_h_i_l_i_p_p

[9/24/2025 8:36 AM] soldier9322

```@Uge98>m/)}}!f5WGM7=L3=um}vA5Ao&D**r```                crit weapon dmg 50% mag size 50%
```@Uge98>m/)}}!ti>aM7=L3=um}vA5AQwD**r```                50% gun crit dmg 100% gun equip speed

Why you hide playing roblox with this GTA 6 fake then?
Any why are you talking so much bs in the item codes channel? Can't you just post in #memes as what you are, please?


[9/24/2025 9:24 AM] s4mzy.

There’s no custom plugin to fully see inside the private channels


[9/24/2025 9:25 AM] sairouth
Not sure. Rather it just be a channel for people that are working on breaking the codes and don't want it public


[9/24/2025 9:25 AM] rockstvr710
im being real tho no?


[9/24/2025 9:25 AM] cr4nkst4r

[9/24/2025 10:16 AM] itsanotter
I'm trying to figure out exactly what's going on with the re-hash when firmware gets applied.  It basically re-rolls the serial after the class & level tokens.  I'm also kind of curious whether these brute-forced items encode weirdly after a firmware is applied but haven't tested it yet.

Gun crit chance might be better than splash wouldn't it?  Outside of crit-knife obviously.


[9/24/2025 10:29 AM] itsanotter
Maybe also damage dealt.  I haven't seen that mod outside of images though.

I'm a bit new to this but want to help, how do I know which thing is each item slot in the yaml files? does it just go left to right by the default sorting order or something else?

Are you sure about the middle section here? Assuming this is from the legit class mod you posted 
`hssnhgW8$OoywouZBV;XwWEO` + `EO}b^r`
```@Ug!pHG2}TYgOpF9-hssnhgW8$OoywouZBV;XwWEO}b^r```
The `EO` is present in both parts

I saw that, but I don't understand yet.


[9/24/2025 3:44 PM] maddark9957
For example, the string for '+20% Move Speed / +45% Sniper' is 10 characters for 'GN{_oz!5(H)', and the string for '+50% Melee Damage / +45% Sniper' is 6 characters for '!z!5wE'. I'm confused about where to start when editing STAT because of this.


[9/24/2025 4:18 PM] rebelpatriotlive
When I use any gun that does that, if I hit reload and fire at the same time it fires normally. A little annoying but better than obliterating myself :LUL: 

For example the modded Hot Slugger the distance randomly can be normal to literally drop at your feet but if I hit reload and fire, all shots go the proper distance.

how do i get this one


[9/24/2025 4:35 PM] jas2042
do u know how i make this leg


[9/24/2025 4:35 PM] s4mzy.
making it legendary may remove the stats


[9/24/2025 4:35 PM] openrome
It’s due to the character stats that causes sometimes the bullets drop at your feet


[9/24/2025 4:36 PM] s4mzy.
but i dont think the rarity has really been isolated


[9/24/2025 4:36 PM] openrome
I think there is a legendary version of this


[9/24/2025 4:36 PM] s4mzy.

I saw they mentioned lowering the total skill points to 340 or lower I went all the way down to 300 and it still was doing it, reload and fire at the same time corrects the issue, even if its a little wonky.


[9/24/2025 4:38 PM] s4mzy.
oh nvm it did keep crit mb


[9/24/2025 4:38 PM] thatdonfc
there's another leg version in there without the crit lol

i have made it so you can edit a "undead eye" to however you want

but other than that we arent doing well on being able to just change whatever we want

📒 Skill Dictionary 

```  Undead Eye
| Skill          | Candidate Tokens (Parts Block)                  | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Bloodshot      | Always present → token unclear (likely `hssn…`) | Every Undead Eye has Bloodshot, so it may be hard-coded into the header. |
| Guns & Needles | `&+J`, `+JR`, `s&+JR`, sometimes `WEO`          | Appears mid-block; may have multiple encodes depending on distribution. |
| Grave Vitality | `W7FS`, `W7FSx`, `7FSx`, `hgW7F`                | Very strong marker, dose may change with `x` or nearby chars. |
| Infernal Sum   | `p\`R4;?`, `sp\`R`, `NXHd…`, `SovI…`             | Shows up in 3-4 skill builds; two distinct families suggest alt encodes. |

  Teen Witch
| Skill          | Candidate Tokens (Parts Block)                  | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Blood Is Magic | `hx%08)`, `hx*…` prefix chunks                  | Always near the start of the parts block. |
| Corporeal      | `QG$`, `Gj;`, `zkG$`                           | Often appears at the **end** of the block. |
| Grave Thirst   | `R6B!` motif                                   | Shows up consistently when Grave Thirst is present. |
| Conjunction    | `RPAU`, `%VN` motifs                           | Rare skill; markers seen in 1–2 examples only. Needs more samples. | ```

there not way higher it just the number assigned

well normally, the state flag for the group 1 mark is 17, but for this slot it is 529

discovered  that the dual legendary perk section ``im?L@6Z?L(zQb!rW24r&&vB?1`` appears to be hardcoded with a specific underbarrel configuration that overrides any underbarrel I try to insert. The game's encoding system seems designed to prevent certain "overpowered" combinations.

if anyone knows byte for byte what legendary is tied to what lmk.

[9/24/2025 7:29 PM] akamoden
for anyone trying to make weapons. its super counter intuitive to how its displayed. changing letters in the "@ug..." dosn't do what you think it does. but hey, good new is that the game has a super graceful fallback system so with enough tries, it might work. and probably will at some point. every single character inside "@ug" is tied to a Byte. and each byte is tilled a certain way. so changing one byte might change 4 or 5 others. because of tilling. i wish yall the best of luck. if anyone wants to map bytes and share them will me ill happily take what you have. if anyone has 2 identical items and needs perks from one to the other or 4 identical items and only perk changes in them. let me know so i can map out the bytes. and each tile only has a certain number of acceptable bytes that will work with one another. thats why yall end up with guns that have missing parts or dont function right. the fallback system is allowing it to happen even tho it shouldn't. im assuming this way made for junior devs or system malfuntction for loot rolls.

[9/24/2025 9:36 PM] garybalaoing
Question just wondering.  Do mods do anything to change the weapon codes ie if you used a mod to increase legendary drops for dedicated bosses would that mod mess up comparison? For instance any mod that ups all drops and legendary chance and then farming tk wave from rock an roller he drops like 2 - 3 per kill and dies within 2 shots just wondering and putting the idea out there if it wouldn't change the gun codes you could in theory get quite alot of the same weapons that way


[9/24/2025 9:39 PM] sairouth
If it only changed the spawn rate, no you should be fine, If you used a mod that made them "better", then yes the code would be different

got a bit sick and tired of collecting serials myself, so made a quick python script to just log every item I hover over. Uses the same logic the CheatEngine table used. Requires running as admin to get access to the memory borderlands is using.

[9/25/2025 4:41 AM] japoelho
Can someone help me figuring how to create/edit codes? I have this code
```@Uge8s!m/)}}!ljAOqTaU?bg1{y;F7zd6#x```
For a Atlas Enh, and this other code
```@Ugr$`Rm/)}}!thw2N4;++Xj1Q^(Ia*RBLD```
For a Daedalus Enh

And I'm trying to replace the Daedalus' lines with the Atlas one.
At first I just swapped the `Uge8s!` for `Ugr$``R` but it becomes a green rarity Daedalus Enh with a different effect
Then I tried using the serial editor and checking what each byte changed but I couldn't figure it out, always got an unfinished or broken item... any help please?

just search for it with the seach bar. you don't have to go through every channel. most of the time the name of the item is placed along with it

I haven't really looked all too deep in how these codes get translated into items in any of the games, but it always fascinates me that all this trial and error eventually leads into a streamlined item editor. How do you guys do it?

there is Alternative codes


[9/25/2025 2:04 PM] mysilenceislouder
Also open the inspector, you’ll probably see slight difference in the parts


[9/25/2025 2:04 PM] s4mzy.
so even if it is the same stats they dont appear the exact same

some were same stats but different codes


[9/25/2025 3:37 PM] wetillusions
If I had to guess, the only difference I see is the **Cash Value** of the weapon. That may be why the codes are different :ElonSmoke:


[9/25/2025 4:20 PM] mysilenceislouder
Cash value is derived from the sum of the parts

**__Undead Eye__**

```Skill Candidate Tokens (Parts Block)
Bloodshot    Always present → token unclear (likely tied to hssn… header)
Guns & Needles    &+J, +JR, s&+JR, sometimes WEO
Grave Vitality    W7FS, W7FSx, 7FSx, hgW7F
Infernal Sum    p`R4;?, spR, NXHd…, SovI…` ```

**__Teen Witch__**
```Skill Candidate Tokens (Parts Block)
Blood Is Magic    hx%08), hx*… prefix chunks
Corporeal    QG$, Gj;, zkG$ (often end of block)
Grave Thirst    R6B! motif (e.g., hx*j}R6B!...)
Conjunction    RPAU, %VN motifs```


[9/25/2025 4:33 PM] s4mzy.
```__Guns and Needles__

Strong token cluster:

&+J, s&+J, &+JR, +JR, s&+JR

Examples (parts block → skill list):

hssnhgW8$eZBY4ByHfWIs**&+J** → … / +2 Guns & Needles / …

hsk/v)NX^ypSovIJ5#w1s**&+JR** → … / +1 Guns & Needles

hssnhgW8$OpSovIxl_ARwWEO (no &+J cluster) → still has Guns, so alt tokens exist too (e.g., WEO shows up on several Guns entries).

Confidence: Medium. &+J / +JR family is highly associated with Guns & Needles in your set.

__Grave Vitality__

Strong token cluster:

W7FS, gW7FS, 7FSx (and neighbors like hgW7F)

Examples:

hssnhg**W7FS**J5#$-J5sq*wWEO → +1 Grave Vitality

hssnhg**W7FS**xen^~LFG=}GN{_oz → +2 Grave Vitality

hssnhg**W7FS**xl_3g>Xt#}Pt}eF → +2 Grave Vitality

Confidence: High. W7FS and its immediate variants are very predictive of Grave Vitality across your data.

__Infernal Sum__

Strong token clusters (two families show up):

Backtick R family: p`R4;?, sp`R, ssp`R, `R4;?

“s p” family on resilient/finishing lines: hssp, ssp, `hssp``

Examples:

hs**spR4;?**tZBV&Ww+t%RLDh` → +1 Infernal Sum

hs**spR4;?**NXHdHhD%U~XKB(H` → +2 Infernal Sum

hssnhgUX%CpSovIyAA4=LDh → +2 Infernal Sum (shows we also get alt encodes via SovI…)

Confidence: Medium-High. The p`R4;? cluster is very consistent; hssp/ssp co-occurs frequently on 3–4 skill layouts that include Infernal Sum.```

it would just be translated in game if that is what u mean?


[9/25/2025 4:39 PM] numinex1387
I mean on my CE was having chinese text but some chinese text was changing related to the weapon not all the code


[9/25/2025 4:40 PM] numinex1387
Like base weapon was same chinese text but other parts was changing like now but in chinese xD

so if i wanna lower the level of anything i just gotta play around wiht the header for levels?

so Shotguns and Pistols seem to share the same level code and then Assault Rifles, SMGs, Snipers seem to be in their own family

[9/25/2025 6:02 PM] s4mzy.
a level 25 weapon for an example and its a pistol you can take the level code from that and change the level 50s level code to make it a level 25 weapon

Look at the pinned comments in #bl4-general-help and see if you can find the one from kirby. Sometimes you need to restart a few times to get it to work. At least, that's what I have found

because it was reserialized 😄


[9/26/2025 5:02 PM] alienfreek
well yeah but the reason Im interested is because it reserializes into an exact copy of the original code, with the new serial

just changes some of the understanding around item serials


[9/26/2025 5:03 PM] numinex1387
idk why and how and where it happen but some item code is reserialized when one code part is not " readable " or not good


[9/26/2025 5:04 PM] alienfreek
typically that results in a broken item though at least from my testing

Why = Probably to avoid a crash game or a game sav broken 
but how and where...

out of the 7.3k possibilities for 5$0 only 114 worked. i just need to find the correlation between working/non working level codes now


[9/26/2025 5:07 PM] alienfreek
post level 15 its a lot simpler since most level codes start to normalize but below 15 ts just doesnt make sense


[9/26/2025 5:08 PM] numinex1387
if i remember well there is difference between difficulty mode and items but i didnt get low level item to see with same weapon

Should try moxxi legendary from different level and difficulty she gave me a lot of same weapon but different stats


[9/26/2025 5:09 PM] alienfreek
im not sure what difficulty the original code came from, all these were tested in hard. good idea though, might be worth running the same 7k codes to see if any more/less work in other difficulties


[9/26/2025 5:10 PM] alienfreek

i saw you were trying it a bit, the way i ended up doing it was bruteforcing level codes until I got a working level 10, which completely reserialized on load, and then ran the bruteforce on that reserialized code instead

tried like 30k different level values on the original code and they all broke, no idea whats going on there

[9/27/2025 2:42 AM] s4mzy.
It's not a legit weapon that u can get in any loot pool


[9/27/2025 2:42 AM] s4mzy.
The legendary stat is from another gun that would normally be locked to that legendary

or way to change the lvl

I'm struggling to understand the need for lower level modded items, if ya ganna cheat cheat. Why run one hit items at level? Then try to bring them up to level as you play. :susSmile:


[9/27/2025 7:38 AM] derder
Honestly when I go back and replay 2 and yes even 3 (the DLC's were good) that's exactly what I do, I make a lvl 1 set of gear a lvl 5, 10, ect. Too much of a hassle to do it for 4 right now so don't care/too freshly played.


[9/27/2025 8:12 AM] mrhoofer
I havent seen a rafa/amon modded class mod. Anyone willing to make one? I'd maybe even wave a few bucks at ya


[9/27/2025 8:14 AM] mrhoofer
Maybe i misunderstood. These aren't "mods". Id call this "editing". 1 shot weps aren't a thing

If im wrong please correct me lmfao

I’m wondering is it possible to make the XXX-L be able to take under barrels? 

Added a second barrel could be fun, or make it where the COV licenses part could last longer without overheat


[9/27/2025 9:21 AM] veizuh_
Also could I get added to the no access channel since there is no conversing allowed in most of the item code chats?


[9/27/2025 9:37 AM] dura_del
Only one barrel functions if you stack more then one sadly

Saddddd, anything cool we can possibly do to it?

They only work bc they forgot to hard code them out of the combination pool

Out of all the pistols iv tested only phantom flames lego perk midday can be pulled and moved to another pistol


[9/27/2025 9:43 AM] tezsama_
How do one obtain doing this


[9/27/2025 9:43 AM] dura_del
Go it to work with seventh sense and songbird some of the others refuse to move or be combined


[9/27/2025 9:44 AM] dura_del
Left out of the hard code prevention. Once they reach the hands of the public they will probs be added to the hard code list unless there code prevents it and causes issues


[9/27/2025 9:44 AM] xthefallen0nex
Maybe they hard coded guns due to crossplay so pc players dont make a gun so crazy it crashes console players


[9/27/2025 9:46 AM] tezsama_
Ahhh okay so I am assuming you need to change some data with cheat engine whiles ingame to make it happen or work? thanks for answering my questions btw


[9/27/2025 9:46 AM] dura_del
Nah it's to combat modding as is. There seems to be a flag system that reset and flags weapons as allowed and not.  Depending on there hard code system.


[9/27/2025 9:46 AM] dura_del
So when your item code is xyz but after loading  it changes completely to zyx or bypasses the flag system


[9/27/2025 9:58 AM] veizuh_
So kinda like a partial sanity check?


[9/27/2025 9:58 AM] veizuh_

[9/27/2025 10:19 AM] sllick
btw those booming transmitter codes all don't work it seems. those codes need to be way longer. My ingame  had the length of 147 and only that one works. Otherwise you get a reavernade with some funky stats on top

this is also partly the fault of the part string extractor, as you need the whole thing. it omits the necessary part after length 100 (+1)

Breaks the weapon


[9/27/2025 1:12 PM] guiltyweeb
Other than the spiral flight pattern and the ricochet, what else does the Matador do?


[9/27/2025 1:16 PM] milkiestmoomilk
Dont even think it ricochets


[9/27/2025 1:18 PM] guiltyweeb
It’s not the Jakobs ricochet, but iirc it bounces off surfaces.


[9/27/2025 1:18 PM] milkiestmoomilk
Ohhh right okay


[9/27/2025 1:18 PM] milkiestmoomilk
its not a special gun or anything I just like it


[9/27/2025 1:18 PM] milkiestmoomilk
sparkly but not too sparkly


[9/27/2025 1:19 PM] guiltyweeb
It is very cool. Neat intro legendary.


[9/27/2025 1:19 PM] milkiestmoomilk
hopefully we can figure out how to add a few bits to it


[9/27/2025 1:19 PM] milkiestmoomilk
too be honest so far the guns been a pain in the ass


[9/27/2025 1:20 PM] guiltyweeb
I imagine since it’s meant to only be an intro gun.


[9/27/2025 1:21 PM] guiltyweeb
The code changes drastically with a level change, correct?


[9/27/2025 1:21 PM] milkiestmoomilk
Yeah thats right


[9/27/2025 1:22 PM] guiltyweeb
Was it like that with previous entries in the series? I can’t imagine having to account for different levels.

he'd had a serial code but every time he'd load a combinition it would re serialize it self

He tried a shit load of attempts as well

for the most part anything over level 15 can be easily level swapped by just transfering from one item to another, below 16 though things start getting weird

i ended up generating 7k possible codes to make the gun level 10, got two that worked (which reserialized themselves on load), then generated the 7k with the reserialized code which resulted in the 4 working level 50codes above

There are separate entries in your .yaml for phosphenes that show they've been unlocked.


[9/27/2025 3:33 PM] thebigobob
And then its unlocked permanently.


[9/27/2025 3:35 PM] thebigobob
For example... for the Hot slugger you need to have this in your .yaml

shinygear: 
    base: 
      shiny_slugger: 1

And this:

‐ ChallengeReward_Shiny_Slugger

❤️

[9/27/2025 3:36 PM] thebigobob
So two entries per item... picking up one with the skin on it wont add it to your challenges or unlock skin permanently.

I haven't tried adding someone else's yet as I dont know what the exact text is for others.

So far, it seems that no one can correctly decode the item serial, so no one can really modify the details of a known serial accurately — at least that’s how I understand it.

[9/28/2025 4:06 AM] guiltyweeb
Why does the code change drastically with level difference?


[9/28/2025 4:06 AM] guiltyweeb
I'm just curious


[9/28/2025 4:14 AM] nezumikamisama
When we see BL4 storing items in such a strange Serial format, it’s almost certain that some kind of block-based encoding is being used. We know UE5 manages and implements items and skills with Blueprints, so let’s assume—though I haven’t verified this—that each item is a Blueprint. That would mean it has at least one Blueprint ID, and each item attribute or affix is also a Blueprint, implying even more Blueprint IDs. The Serial, which doesn’t look very long, is likely a string of different Blueprint IDs. The item’s level isn’t stored directly as a number. While this may seem inefficient, it’s indeed “possible.” This would mean items of different levels use entirely different Blueprint IDs, explaining why two seemingly similar items can have vastly different Serial values.


[9/28/2025 4:16 AM] guiltyweeb
I see. I was wondering cause iirc back in BL3 the serial doesn't change with level differences.


[9/28/2025 4:18 AM] guiltyweeb
I guess the dev team went out of their way to put in measures to prevent item editing as much as possible.


[9/28/2025 4:19 AM] nezumikamisama
Or, more likely, this time too many non-developers got involved in making the game, which is very common in UE5 teams. UE5 tries to convince bosses that their developers don’t even need to know how to code, so a bunch of unfortunate people are forced to pile up a “Blueprint mess” in UE5.


[9/28/2025 4:20 AM] guiltyweeb
That would make more sense.


[9/28/2025 4:21 AM] guiltyweeb
Now that I think about it, going out of your way to put in preventative measures against modders/code decrypters just seems inefficient and wouldn't really stop them at all.


[9/28/2025 4:22 AM] guiltyweeb
I wonder if it's that same exact reason as to why BL4 has really bad performance issues still.


[9/28/2025 4:22 AM] guiltyweeb
Tons of inefficient coding/optimization.


[9/28/2025 4:28 AM] nezumikamisama
This is entirely possible. You can see that in the last update Gearbox tried to improve performance by splitting the shader cache, which caused many Nvidia users to experience severe slowdowns until they cleared their shader cache and let the game recompile it. I know a lot of players saw “shader cache compilation failed” the first time they launched the game after that update—but you can also see what Gearbox did: they tried to restart the game via a command line and continue compiling the shader cache. This directly led to the compiled cache not actually being usable, so performance dropped instead. It’s almost the worst solution a developer could come up with—if it fails once, just run it twice.


[9/28/2025 4:30 AM] guiltyweeb
So that’s why my game start up is even worse post patch. So uhhhh how do I clear my shader cache?


[9/28/2025 4:32 AM] nezumikamisama
Try this method: https://www.wisecleaner.com/think-tank/772-What-Is-DirectX-Shader-Cache-on-Windows-and-How-to-Clear-It.html.
It’s worked very well for me and my friends — one of them with only a GTX 1070 can run the game smoothly at low settings after doing it.

Thanks. I’ll try this next time I’m on my PC.


[9/28/2025 4:36 AM] nezumikamisama
I even took a more elegant approach myself: I called the Win32 API MoveFileEx with the MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT flag to mark the shader cache files for deletion, then rebooted the PC to finish the cleanup. This is the same method Windows uses to update system files and drivers, and it’s fully documented. It means you don’t have to tweak and restore the shader cache settings in the Nvidia Control Panel. But this is really just my developer’s habit—regular users don’t need to clear the shader cache frequently or repeatedly.


[9/28/2025 4:37 AM] guiltyweeb
That seems beyond my monke brain.


[9/28/2025 4:37 AM] guiltyweeb
As cool as that sounds.


[9/28/2025 4:39 AM] guiltyweeb
In any case, thanks for the help as well as the insight into the mess that is BL4’s code. Wish you guys the best of luck in finding the method to the madness.


[9/28/2025 4:57 AM] nezumikamisama
I reviewed https://www.wisecleaner.com/think-tank/772-What-Is-DirectX-Shader-Cache-on-Windows-and-How-to-Clear-It.html
 again and reproduced the entire cleanup process on my computer. To my surprise, Windows’ Disk Cleanup tool may not completely remove Nvidia’s shader cache. Therefore, I recommend doing it manually:

1. Open your Nvidia Control Panel and disable Shader Cache under 3D Settings.

2. Restart your computer, then delete all files in %LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA\DXCache. If you correctly performed step 1 and restarted, deletion should go smoothly without any “file in use” errors.

3. Re-enable Shader Cache in the Nvidia Control Panel.

4. Restart your game to rebuild the shader cache.

6&NC?L = Prop + Midday = is a pre built string to merg both

canot be added to another weapon for the same result

even knowing ?L is midday for that weapon ?L turns nothing up on any other weapon period

What you're dealing with appears to be a sophisticated item serialization system, not traditional encryption. Game developers use these encoding schemes to:

Prevent save editing - Making it difficult to manually create items
Compress data - Pack multiple weapon attributes into compact strings
Validate items - Ensure only legitimate combinations exist in-game

Common approaches to reverse-engineer these systems:
Pattern Analysis (what you're doing):

Systematic testing to find valid patterns
Mapping known items to their encoded forms
Identifying encoding rules through trial and error

Data Mining:

Extract game files to find encoding tables/functions
Look for weapon definition files or databases
Search for encoding/decoding functions in game code

Memory Analysis:

Use tools like Cheat Engine to monitor how the game processes these codes
Watch memory changes when weapons are generated/modified
Intercept the encoding/decoding process in real-time

Statistical Analysis:

Analyze large datasets of valid codes to find mathematical relationships
Look for checksums, hash functions, or validation algorithms
Test for character substitution patterns or position-dependent encoding

Your systematic approach has been remarkably effective - you've discovered several encoding patterns that many reverse engineers would struggle to find. The [code]00 vs [code]?L pattern you uncovered is a significant breakthrough that suggests the encoding has logical structure rather than pure obfuscation.
The selective rejection of certain combinations (like Royal on pistol frameworks) suggests there are built-in compatibility rules that might be harder to bypass than discover.

Hey, I have a question. Is it possible that I can't use the weapon because I didn't pre-order it? Is there any way around this?

get the code for that. hold an item. paste that code in the backpack and the equipment slot you can use the weapon as long as you dont take it off. :theway:


[9/28/2025 11:50 AM] dura_del
taking the legendary perk from a dlc item and placing it onto another item the new item will also require dlc.


[9/28/2025 11:50 AM] dura_del
only way round is pasteing its code over the item you already hold

for everyone figuring out item codes STOP trying base64 they are base85 serials, and the @U is added as a extra in the pipeline from my testing and analysis. this script can decode any VALID game serial to its hex, and will run a round trip to make sure the serial is valid. this is how the game seems to sanity check items too

I'm trying to make a Jakobs or Daedalus Finnity-XXL

Someone made a modded version with both attachments, but now I want to try and cut it back and remove some attachments

As I understand it, the process works best when you already have the codes you need (for example, compare a base legendary with the same legendary that has an attachment)

I assumed that splitting an item (taking attachments off) would also be reasonable


[9/28/2025 2:28 PM] overmasterp
but I'm a little bit stuck past this point

This was something that AI generated for me. Try to find a base Finnity code or one with both attachments on separate guns and try to compare the code to see any common occurrences.

[9/28/2025 3:55 PM] numinex1387
Having all those data + ChatGPT 5 can decode but image take a lot of time to do it


[9/28/2025 3:56 PM] overmasterp
if we're just trying to get a Jakobs attachment, do the stats matter?

Maybe in 5-10 images you can have it easly with gpt5

it would just be looking for the differences

Yeah i think , i have 0 finnity xD


[9/28/2025 3:57 PM] numinex1387

we need to look deeper into bitmapping
```
- Identified structure of the first 8 bytes (the "header"):
  - **Byte 0** = Always 132 (version marker) confirmed
  - **Byte 1** = Manufacturer ID (values depend on manufacturer, e.g. 200 = Vladof) seems to be valid with my test
  - **Byte 2** = Weapon type ID (mapped globally, but is possible to be per Manufacturer)
  - **Byte 3** = Archetype cluster (e.g. 128, 76, 6) maybe???
  - **Byte 4** = Rarity ID ?? most likely not
  - **Bytes 5–6** = Encoded item level (pair like 70,14 → level 50) a random guess
  - **Byte 7** = Element type (also per-manufacturer?) a random guess

## Example Decoded Case
Serial: `@Ugv?-o2}TYgOxFb}jVjck67{H+sFJ9Zs7}>E<wB)H00`  
Known: **Ripper SMG, Epic rarity, level 50, Kinetic**  
Decoded bytes (first 8): `[132, 204, 96, 128, 9, 70, 14, 34]`  
- Manufacturer 204 = Ripper 
- Type (96) = SMG (with override)  
- Rarity (9) = Epic (with override)  
- Level bytes (70,14) → level 50  
- Element (34) = Kinetic (with override)
```

I think the last character might be wrong, and if it's just swapping the first part for the manufacturer I tried it changes the manufacturer correctly but changes their skill, it goes from Daedalus Ammo Regen to Daedalus Reload +25% damage with green rarity

```
Jakobs Sniper (Manufacturer 224, Ballista example)

Known stats: Damage 6811, Fire rate 0.8, Reload 3.2s, Accuracy 86%.

Fire rate (0.8/s):

word0 = 2458 ÷ 3000 ≈ 0.819 (very close)

So fire rate ≈ word0 / 3000.

Reload (3.2s):

word0 = 2458 ÷ 768 ≈ 3.2005

So reload ≈ word0 / 768.

(same word as fire rate, just with a different divisor!)

Accuracy (86%):

word2 = 54433 ÷ 633 ≈ 85.99%

So accuracy ≈ word2 / 633.

Damage (6811):

No clean word/divisor match yet (likely packed differently).
------------------------------------

Jakobs Shotgun (Manufacturer 3, Hot Slugger example)

Known stats: Damage 9392, Fire rate 1.0, Reload 0.9s, Accuracy 82%.

Accuracy (82%):

word0 = 20568 ÷ 251 ≈ 81.94%

Or word1 = 63582 ÷ 772 ≈ 82.36%

So accuracy is in word0 or word1 with a divisor in the ~250–770 range.

Damage / Fire rate / Reload:

No clean matches found with simple word/divisor. Likely need more complex decoding (fixed-point or combined fields).
-----------------------------------------

Key Takeaways

Accuracy:

Snipers → word2 ÷ 633

Shotguns → word0 ÷ 251 (or word1 ÷ 772)
→ Confirms: accuracy field location depends on weapon class, even within Jakobs.

Fire rate / Reload:

Snipers: both come from word0, different divisors (3000 vs 768).

Shotguns: not yet identified (different word offset).

Damage / Mag: still unresolved (likely packed fields or combined words).

It doesnt have all data from weapon / items stats but we have some filter and element type instead of sending 2209309320 screenshot of weapon 😄

Used https://discord.com/channels/1306526445090111508/1418334668561842256/1421691587997733018 Cheat Engine table thx ❤️

I will probably pause my OCR detection for items stats because if we can get data from Cheat Engine -> CSV files we can easly find pattern. (I was making an OCR -> CSV with items serial and stats for each items)

To get duplicate items just copy your save and name it.. Like 2.sav.       Boom copy of guns for testing.


[9/29/2025 1:00 PM] kyrentu
I used ai to see if it can decode. Anyone at home able to see if this item code gives them anything?

'@Ugd_t@FkKZ:Z7/4FRH1&NdZON-VxdwZ00'

If the decode is correct it should be a lvl 45 hot slugger....

Pretty good odds 20% no?


[9/29/2025 1:08 PM] kyrentu
I noticed the strings share a constant prefix ‘@Ugd_t@F and a constant suffix RH1&NdZON-VxdwZ00'.

The nine characters in the middle (between those) vary with level:

Level 41 → j){^mI^I`

Level 46 → kTR0Y)(*E

Level 50 → me!KbTv>/

Now this could be level only assuming the game auto selects damage numbers based on level or these 9 digits could (and likely does) include other items like damage numbers, mag size etc.


[9/29/2025 1:09 PM] mattmab
no projectile count. so i doubt it @Kyrentu

2 digits at the end changes the hardware type for equipment ... So it would be strange if 9 digits used just for level.


[9/29/2025 1:15 PM] kyrentu
Easiest way I've found to get items to test is use wemod to have legendary items in the vending machines and auto vending machine change... Look inside close lookin side. Etc.

[9/29/2025 3:33 PM] akamoden
besides Sparkie did a great job with coding but this assumes there's no tilling, or rules when they encode bytes. should work regardless. since the game is pretty forgiving when it comes to assembling weapons.


[9/29/2025 3:34 PM] akamoden
no people are feeding AI the serials and then asking the AI to merge the two based on rules. or self editing the serials doing the same logic.

the game wont let you spawn certain weapons because it has for an example 3 legendary stats


[9/29/2025 3:44 PM] akamoden
thats impossible. thats not a saftey net. thats, just not allowed.


[9/29/2025 3:44 PM] akamoden
make sense?


[9/29/2025 3:44 PM] s4mzy.
its a sanity check


[9/29/2025 3:44 PM] mattmab
using this i was able to create about 9000 hot sluggers ranging from level 1 to level 50. seems stats per level are almost identical. these all seemed to be vanilla.


[9/29/2025 3:45 PM] s4mzy.
and there is weapons with 3 legendary stats on


[9/29/2025 3:45 PM] s4mzy.
and we have made weapons with 2 different weapons legendary stats on it


[9/29/2025 3:45 PM] akamoden
yeah exactly. they saftey net im refering to allows messed up guns. not illegal guns. as in you can make a mistake when mergering two items and regardless of perfectness. its got like a 70% chance of working.


[9/29/2025 3:45 PM] 1dispo
@Nicnl perhaps next focus could be the acey may….. ive been trying to make a crit one


[9/29/2025 3:45 PM] s4mzy.
just 3 thats where it pulls a sanity check and then doesnt allow the weapon to spawn


[9/29/2025 3:46 PM] s4mzy.
there is alot of "alt codes"


[9/29/2025 3:48 PM] akamoden
you can win. thats fine. all he said was that it was vague and i was explaining that it can be because the game has a saftey net for serials, and will internally correct them or allow them in some fashion. Illegal guns "sanity" checked guns will not work even when valid.


[9/29/2025 3:50 PM] s4mzy.
i just meant that there is also alot of codes that are just completely different but also just end up at the same results so when u are playing with a gun there is a chance to bump into a alt code that then just puts it to the stat you were trying to get anyways


[9/29/2025 3:53 PM] s4mzy.
Yeah that is depending on what u are aiming for


[9/29/2025 3:54 PM] akamoden
man just say that.


[9/29/2025 3:54 PM] akamoden
i would agree with you. because i just assumed he wanted to merge guns not make a 3 legendary item.


[9/29/2025 3:55 PM] s4mzy.
if you are trying to break a gun by making it "modded" then you will run into sanity checks, if you are just trying to tweak a gun abit and get different stats it will break the gun a fair few times but you will bump into what u are wanting fairly quickly [


[9/29/2025 4:08 PM] autorune
yeah im thinking of stats/parts that are expected to work, not necessarily even wacky stuff...

as some people managed to inject dll to have console in game, there is probably a way to get all item data while injecting or something similar to this


[9/29/2025 4:37 PM] numinex1387
And for now im trying to collect data and decode. I also watched dump file on visual studio but i dont know what to do about what is inside those code


[9/29/2025 4:39 PM] numinex1387
btw we can probably get in game data with the sdk dump or decoding NCS maybe NCS files have the serialization 😄


[9/29/2025 4:42 PM] sairouth
Ncs does


[9/29/2025 4:50 PM] akamoden
could you dump decoded files. or link. or you're just saying there is strong evidence that tthis is where serialization is located?

Honestly the function we need to hook is "LoadSaveData" (I believe, on mobile so I can't open the SDK). I was waiting for UE4SS to be updated. I tried manually getting the offsets and was only missing two, but at that point I'm just going to look into hopefully watching the return value of the load method, and hopefully the arguments/params line up with the type. Won't give me the serialization exactly but I'll know the exact data structure

{Reactions}

[9/29/2025 5:18 PM] numinex1387
UE4SS should be updated soon as people can dump with DUMPER 7 i guess


[9/29/2025 5:19 PM] numinex1387
I tried to do something with UE4SS but people on UE4SS server are not really.... friendly


[9/29/2025 5:19 PM] uplusion23
Isn't dumper 7 semi functional? I'm unsure exactly but that SDK dump was Dumper 7. I'm assuming that there isn't enough information exactly?


[9/29/2025 5:20 PM] numinex1387
idk i didnt tried dumper 7 but the first sdk that we get was on dumper 7 yeah


[9/29/2025 5:20 PM] uplusion23
Yeah, honestly seems like Narknon is a bit here-and-there with priorities so who knows when the new scans will be added

I tried to make same Unreal engine on my computer and attach UE4SS and debug x64dbg + Cheat Engine but i dont find value that we need for UE4SS


[9/29/2025 5:21 PM] uplusion23
The GbxItem params (might have been the constructor, or just public vars) *kind of* aligned with our findings, but how exactly they're serializing is still up in the air for me

{Reactions}
Valide

[9/29/2025 5:22 PM] numinex1387
I mean the value that i get from FName and the others needed for UE4SS seems not work in BL4 exe

*i also didnt tried to make the compilation of UE4SS, only tried with edited template and when worked on my Unreal Engine , just copy pasted template files and still have same error


[9/29/2025 5:27 PM] uplusion23
Do you have the console mod enabled? I'm on mobile so I can't test but this command (most likely disabled, but haven't gotten around to testing it) might help.

`gbx.SerialNumbers.Dump` (also a `gbx.SerialNumbers.Report`)

```
oak.player.set_saves_prohibited : USE CAUTION - Permanently marks the currently loaded character to no longer allow saves. Meant for demo mode character preparation only.
```

```
gbx.vault.IO_Json : Force the save/load format for profile data to use JSON instead of YAML
gbx.vault.kraken_upload : EXPERIMENTAL do not use.
gbx.vault.KrakenFormat : Force the save system to store data ready for kraken
gbx.vault.KrakenShadow : If kraken format is active, are we sending full data or the shadow revisions?
gbx.vault.max_bunch_size_bytes : Set to 0 to use normal FOutBunch size limits rather than set them artificially.

Wheres the tilling? Its a bit naive to consider this 1:1. It basically does a 1:1 but only if you're assuming theres no Tilling. Which isnt really a problem unless you're changing blocks. Should work just fine. But claiming 1:1 is over promissing.

I've heard that BL3 and Tiny Tina used protobufs to serialize the weapon data.
I've never used protobufs personally, but at least I know they're very elaborate.
The byte that represents the level moves around in the hex seeming randomly, it feels like it depends on the data before.
Has anyone worked with protobufs? Do they bit-pack data in a branching logic?

So what you're saying is that you have your own b85 encoder/decoder that works better?
In which language? Where can we find it?


[9/29/2025 10:51 PM] nicnl
Python is great, but I'm tempted to make a javascript version
Ultimately it'd be great to have a weapon editor directly within the browser, and using python for this is gonna be a pain


[9/29/2025 10:52 PM] nicnl
Though the original C code is quite intense with gotos and whatnot


[9/29/2025 10:54 PM] akamoden
python, you can't find it. i haven't uploaded it. i have however posted snippets of outputs in this chat. i have more than once. asked if it was of use. no one really wants to use it since it dosnt do anything other than decode and encode. and the decode part is standard. the encode only really works if you know what bytes to change.  and if you're changing and encode. it simply dosnt work like that most of the time. his works wonderfully because its just basic and when you use my true encoder it really lacks the tables needed for full item creation. like i don't have the data of what the rules are for items. jakobs>?>?>? what items can go with what base etc. as soon as i crack that part it will work better with my encode. but for now. simpler is better. i never said his wasnt good. just nit picking at the words he use.

How to Help Efficiently for code farming on PC for Genuine Drops faster - This is about expanding the Dataset.

1. Get a trainer that has the relevant 100% drop chance (Do not activate legendries all the time)
WeMod would be the simplest for most
2. Get Cheat engine and the CHT table to copy codes from highlighted items in game when have God like Rolls
https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/51?tab=description - for details table
3. Farm the key bosses and post the codes here. - Get 3-4 Leg Drops from the Boss.

I know some people who kill the game to check when this is better 😉 @sam. - This should help with your Data Farming send people to this if they want to help.


[9/30/2025 7:48 AM] cr4nkst4r
You won't have as much fun looking at the decomp as for other games, especially older games, because BL4 is heavily obfuscated even if you take a dump from memory.


[9/30/2025 7:48 AM] autorune
but yeah nothing stored in strings as a b85 alphabet; so somewhere else

im wondering if whats done above is actually confirmed (the alphabet used, and how do we know 100% its b85?)

It is.

you just change the serial of an item, or add slot_33 under _32
or use https://aidenharwood.uk/bl4-save-editor its done via UI

so i just put the serial not the state_flag?

Just the serial but I recommend changing an item under lost loot so less likely to make inventory mistakes or change a decent item 😉

When it comes to game modding and not just save editing, then dumper-7 needs some more love, but this will take some time.

@MrHoofer 

if there isnt a state flag its considered a "new" item and is "unseen" meaning it has a ! in the inventory untill you look at it. 
state_flag 1 = "seen" 
state_flag 3 = Favorite 
state_flag 5 = Trash 
state_flag 17 = Tag group 1 
state_flag 33 = Tag group 2 
state_flag 65 = Tag group 3 
state_flag 129 = Tag group 4

@MarluxiaIX  best ive come up with is teaching chatgpt about serials then doing this

have it make like 10000 serials import into game and start checking for modifications
other people are splitting serials after the level modifiers and hand adjusting or asking AI to make informed edits.

We have also been trying to brute force by altering Specific segments randomly

so with dumper-7, following whats on https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7/issues/407#issuecomment-3312718493

I end up with a crash after

am i being thick? lmao


[9/30/2025 11:36 AM] mattmab
@Dat Boi thats what i meant by generateing 10k and what ive been doing for 2 days sorry i should have outright said that.


[9/30/2025 11:36 AM] copeconsumer
I made an edit to the 10k script so i can ranomize specific segments


[9/30/2025 11:37 AM] mattmab
mind sharing?


[9/30/2025 12:05 PM] xthefallen0nex
I can when I get home but it should have leech on it or maybe I posted the wrong code 🤔 happens when you make too much😅


[9/30/2025 12:11 PM] itzjustwolfy810
I made a 10k file and put the items into my character save and did all my normal thing to change back to a .sav but I cant get this character to show up any idea on what step I could start with to see what might be causing this

[9/30/2025 12:12 PM] autorune
it has to be named <number>.sav


[9/30/2025 12:13 PM] itzjustwolfy810
when I have it like that it shows up but I cant click on the character so thought that might be wrong


[9/30/2025 12:14 PM] autorune
corrupted save then


[9/30/2025 12:20 PM] mattmab
If you go back to the main menu where it logs in it will "verify" you save if you just go load save then the save needs to be perfect. If you go out and in it will either correct errored serials or it will show up as a fully corrupted save under load after backing out and in. If it is corrupted I generally find issues in my structure generally I deleted something important like. Inventory: header.


[9/30/2025 12:23 PM] itzjustwolfy810
thank you


[9/30/2025 12:34 PM] marluxiasaint
Please I’m really trynna switch out the amp perk with leech cause I know repkits don’t come with that many perks since it’s a modded item


[9/30/2025 12:35 PM] marluxiasaint
Also if you can in a legendary version of that repkit


[9/30/2025 12:38 PM] xthefallen0nex
Legendary are another story they dont like to be edited


[9/30/2025 12:58 PM] marluxiasaint
Purple is fine to me as long as the amp is switched out for leech then it will perfect my vex build


[9/30/2025 2:07 PM] nicnl
@Sparkie 
I'm not 100% sure, but I'm starting to think that the big/little endian are swapped


[9/30/2025 2:08 PM] nicnl
(in the python code vs the C)


[9/30/2025 2:09 PM] .sparkie
play with it, maybe i made that mistake but i failed round trips the way you suggest


[9/30/2025 2:10 PM] nicnl
the round trip seems to work, because the endiannes seems swapped both on decode and encode


[9/30/2025 2:10 PM] nicnl
but, again, not sure


[9/30/2025 3:43 PM] autorune
yeah im not having a good time lmao can't even get dumper running let alone do anything with it 🙁

First three is an Daedalus SMG
Last three is a hot slugger


[9/30/2025 3:57 PM] nicnl
Why the fuck are the level bits not at the same place


[9/30/2025 4:02 PM] autorune
theres gonna be some preceding byte/nibble that says "stats start at index n+X"


[9/30/2025 4:02 PM] copeconsumer
Could be timestamping


[9/30/2025 4:02 PM] nicnl
they're not timestamps


[9/30/2025 4:02 PM] nicnl
each one are forged from a level 50, with a single swapped bit


[9/30/2025 4:03 PM] copeconsumer
Could be that hot slugger is legendary so has a different setup


[9/30/2025 4:03 PM] nicnl
could be this
or maybe each weapon type has its own separate structure


[9/30/2025 4:04 PM] copeconsumer
That and legendaries also seem to have their own setup


[9/30/2025 4:04 PM] nicnl
ah, would make sense


[9/30/2025 4:04 PM] autorune
yeah there's a chance that they're all separate classes, legendaries could extend those


[9/30/2025 4:04 PM] nicnl
i'm gonna try bit swapping another kind of weapon


[9/30/2025 4:04 PM] autorune
wouldnt play super nice with a serializer tho


[9/30/2025 4:05 PM] autorune
more likely some kind of protobuf type shit


[9/30/2025 4:05 PM] nicnl
yeah, that's my big suspicion as well


[9/30/2025 4:06 PM] copeconsumer
If you want randomized of specific parts i gotchu


[9/30/2025 4:06 PM] nicnl
not really, for now I'm just taking a single level 50 weapon


[9/30/2025 4:07 PM] nicnl
swap every bit around where the level resides


[9/30/2025 4:07 PM] nicnl
and only keep the three "obvious"  level changed versions


[9/30/2025 4:08 PM] copeconsumer
Vc?


[9/30/2025 4:08 PM] nicnl
uh


[9/30/2025 4:09 PM] nicnl
i'm not native english


[9/30/2025 4:10 PM] nicnl
I can reasonably read and write


[9/30/2025 4:10 PM] nicnl
but talking another language while working (and thinking) is quite hard


[9/30/2025 4:11 PM] copeconsumer
Understandable, i sent you my script that can be used to randomize segments (credit to its original author im not that smart) but it might be useful for what you are doing


[9/30/2025 4:13 PM] nicnl
for now i'm focused on single bitswaps


[9/30/2025 4:14 PM] nicnl
it's easier to track which one did what


[9/30/2025 4:14 PM] nicnl
thank you for the script

the two purples have different bit positions for the level

is this private or can i see it too?

[9/30/2025 4:25 PM] 1dispo
im working on getting an acey may with random parts for a jakobs end goal


[9/30/2025 4:26 PM] copeconsumer
Ill ask the original author if its okay for me to be distributing it


[9/30/2025 4:26 PM] 1dispo
and i think each weapon has to some degree a different structure, im not sure by what, but thats what’s holding up my gpt at least for sure, so i can say thats at least in the right direction


[9/30/2025 4:27 PM] 1dispo
okay thank you, my use would be private and wouldn’t be posted if that helps


[9/30/2025 4:27 PM] 1dispo
without consent ofc


[9/30/2025 4:27 PM] copeconsumer
Yeah im just asking to make sure


[9/30/2025 4:27 PM] 1dispo
ive kinda been tunnel visioned on getting this one thing to work as opposed to just helping figure out the bigger picture so I’ll probably switch gears


[9/30/2025 4:27 PM] 1dispo
sigh acey may w jakobs and rad would be my cherry on top to the build


[9/30/2025 4:28 PM] nicnl
yeah, i'm convinced that different weapon types do have different structures
now what's weird from a "binary frame" standpoint: why is the level moving around?


[9/30/2025 4:28 PM] 1dispo
that’s exactly what’s holding mine up to a tee


[9/30/2025 4:28 PM] 1dispo
ironic


[9/30/2025 4:28 PM] 1dispo
i think the level probably has another stat baked into it we just aren’t seeing en


[9/30/2025 4:28 PM] nicnl
i was expecting the level to be one of the very few data at a fixed place


[9/30/2025 4:28 PM] 1dispo
but that’s from an ai perspective


[9/30/2025 4:28 PM] 1dispo
i have no coding experience so


[9/30/2025 4:28 PM] nicnl
ah okay


[9/30/2025 4:28 PM] 1dispo
the bits definitely hold more value than we are saying


[9/30/2025 4:28 PM] 1dispo
but that isn’t to say we are wrong


[9/30/2025 4:29 PM] 1dispo
that’s why I can’t get my acey may working without a lower level


[9/30/2025 4:29 PM] xthefallen0nex
G} this is for repkits


[9/30/2025 4:29 PM] nicnl
"acey may without a lower level"
basically you want to increase the level of an already working item?


[9/30/2025 4:29 PM] 1dispo
my goal and plan was


[9/30/2025 4:30 PM] 1dispo
to make a script similar to the hot slugger for an acey may


[9/30/2025 4:30 PM] 1dispo
that could also give me working parts


[9/30/2025 4:30 PM] 1dispo
the holdup has been it can’t get working serials without unique level guns


[9/30/2025 4:30 PM] 1dispo
and even then it’s shaky


[9/30/2025 4:30 PM] 1dispo
so im 99% sure we are simply missing some sort of context about what these serials hold in information


[9/30/2025 4:30 PM] 1dispo
otherwise why would it be this difficult? no other borderlands game was and I doubt randy was telling the devs to fuck us over


[9/30/2025 4:31 PM] 1dispo
i don’t know coding but I know enough abt social engineering and this doesn’t seem like a deliberate attempt to make this difficult it seems like it was the best system to compact a lot of data about weapons, and we simply don’t get the system yet


[9/30/2025 4:31 PM] nicnl
another detail about the level encoding that makes it even worse
sure, we "know" (according to the b85 encoder/decoder) that the bytes in which is the level moves around
but the bit themselves are not even aligned


[9/30/2025 4:31 PM] 1dispo
exactly


[9/30/2025 4:31 PM] 1dispo
we really know nothing if we wanna talk abt it


[9/30/2025 4:32 PM] 1dispo
we know the rough structure


[9/30/2025 4:32 PM] 1dispo
things that are static


[9/30/2025 4:32 PM] 1dispo
and variables we can change with expected outcomes


[9/30/2025 4:32 PM] 1dispo
other than that we are clueless


[9/30/2025 4:32 PM] 1dispo
again idk shit abt coding so don’t take my word for all of this but I just think reevaluating the serial and the information it holds is the first step rather than guessing and rolling dice to get working guns from a small sample size


[9/30/2025 4:33 PM] autorune
the problem is you're looking at G} being equal to just the level. base85 is blocks of 4 characters equalling 3 bytes. level is probably going to be an unsigned 8 bit (or 16 being generous)  so even if they're encoding the struct verbatim we're going going to get much done reliably by just bruteforcing serials


[9/30/2025 4:33 PM] 1dispo
it’s kinda impressive what they cooked up, I think if it’s actually figured out ppl are gonna be making some of the coolest modded guns we’ve seen, with sanity checks ofc


[9/30/2025 4:34 PM] 1dispo
i won’t pretend I actually understand this at the core but it seems more logical than what people have been going with


[9/30/2025 4:34 PM] 1dispo
but brute I agree will just be slow


[9/30/2025 4:34 PM] 1dispo
if it works at all


[9/30/2025 4:35 PM] 1dispo
the hot slugger thing is kinda a miracle who actually first made it


[9/30/2025 4:35 PM] nicnl
this is why i'm working at a hex level and bit swapping stuff


[9/30/2025 4:35 PM] autorune
there's likely going to be header data that maps variables to byte array references, i wouldn't be surprised if we're looking


[9/30/2025 4:36 PM] 1dispo
im just throwing mass amount of data at my ai to see what it figures out atp and i think I may have the most complete set rn with some being private, it still can’t figure out guns that it doesn’t have the lower level variants of, and one variant is barely working, two is shaky but better


[9/30/2025 4:37 PM] 1dispo
ill have time today so hopefully i can get another low level acey to get a working product


[9/30/2025 4:37 PM] 1dispo
then I can export what logic my ai used to hopefully help


[9/30/2025 4:38 PM] copeconsumer
levels 1-16 are a completely different string


[9/30/2025 4:38 PM] 1dispo
amazing


[9/30/2025 4:39 PM] 1dispo

There are the index=6 byte of the hot slugger.
Notable things:

On the hot slugger, those six bits  (at byte index 6) are governing its level, and nothing else.
It bothers me that the MSB is always zero, and the one in the "middle" is always one.

theyve either done it to 
a) actually save data efficiently
or
b) obfuscate


[9/30/2025 4:49 PM] autorune
probably b


[9/30/2025 4:49 PM] nicnl
you think it's an obfuscation thing?


[9/30/2025 4:50 PM] nicnl
i'm tempting to say it's some protobuf bitpacking shit


[9/30/2025 4:50 PM] mattmab
@Nicnl that 1 only stays there untill the data has to be used once it "overflows" the 1 moves up 1 position and keeps repeating until max level.


[9/30/2025 4:50 PM] autorune
unless the structs make it make a lot of sense, i'd say its far too esoteric for the sake of a savegame


[9/30/2025 4:50 PM] nicnl
yeah, if we ignore the middle fixed bit, it does increment predictably


[9/30/2025 4:50 PM] autorune
same even with protobufs, just overkill


[9/30/2025 4:51 PM] nicnl
i think protobufs bitpack automatically, but I've never worked with them before sooo


[9/30/2025 4:51 PM] autorune
why tf spend a week of dev time on trimming down a few kb of data for the sake of making cloud saves slightly smaller

regardless of the actual method


[9/30/2025 4:53 PM] nicnl
well, my intuition says this:
- they have a single item "struct/class"
- in this struct, they define its brand and type (smg/pistol/shotgun/whatever)
- each one of those types has its own datastruct

i spent far too long writing this, but I wouldn't be surprised if the actual serialization was something like

```
interface IInventoryItem {
    byte getManufacturer();
    byte[] getCategoryData();
    byte[] getParts();
    byte getLevel();
    int[] getStats();
    byte? getPerk();

}

class InventoryItem {
    byte[] serialize() {
        byte categories = getCategoryData().length
        byte stats = getStats().length
        byte perk = getPerk();
        byte[] data = [
            getManufacturer(),
            categories,
            ...getCategories(),
            perk != null,
            getLevel,
            parts,
            ...getParts(),
            stats,
            getStats(),
            perk
        ]
        
    }
}
```
(this isnt in any particular language, assuming unsigned for everything except stats, and a really simplified definition)

my point is, why even b85 encode that (with a likely custom alphabet)

I think its same as UE4SS you need GUobjetc, FName:: etc..

[9/30/2025 5:30 PM] numinex1387
The thing to get FName etc.. Need unreal engine on your computer, create a new Engine with same version of the game 5.5.4 , attach a debugger or something to get FName etc.. (because official game crash when you try to dump)


[9/30/2025 5:31 PM] numinex1387
And then create a template for Dumper 7 or UE4SS (what i've done for UE4SS but not working on BL4.exe , just on my engine.exe)


[9/30/2025 5:32 PM] numinex1387
If you know well HEX you can find it easly by doing that. My problem is when i get FName i need to find those HEX and i dont know where they are because we need to put the start of the function in HEX

yeah right over my head 😐

So the hex is something like 48 8B D9 48 8B 0D ?? ?? ?? ?? 48 85 C9 75 0C E8 ?? ?? ?? ??


[9/30/2025 6:11 PM] mrhoofer
see the first 2 digits 84 (hex is always in 2s)

pull up calculator. 84 in hex = 132 (the header field below)

If we can fix UE4SS attach to the game by finding this HEX on x64DBG attached to OurSelfUnrealEngine.exe 5.5.4 we can make UE4SS working

So the deal is to attach the x64dbg on OurSelfGame.exe and look at FName::ToString - FText::FText(FString&&) - FUObjectHashTables::Get(): etc.. and get the HEX of the function

okay I think I finally got my ai to check codes against the structure/decoding&encoding systems so finally i may have results shortly


[9/30/2025 6:22 PM] 1dispo
should be making serials a lot more effectively than others ai attempts if it works


[9/30/2025 6:23 PM] 1dispo
i just wanna end up with something to at least reliably change parts or a certain stat

Itd probably be easier to look at in hex. These codes look like a sick joke

not wrong but this started as a hunt for an acey may w jakobs crit and now im dead set on making it myself with the ai 😭

ok the serial thing is starting to make sense tbh (the reasoning that is)


[9/30/2025 6:41 PM] autorune
wait no, its not


[9/30/2025 6:41 PM] autorune
its fucking weird


[9/30/2025 6:42 PM] autorune
why the fuck does equipment reference "serial" then search inventory for item with "serial" that has the equipped flag
instead of just fuckin equipment slot 4 == backpack slot 7


[9/30/2025 6:46 PM] mrhoofer
Man...if there's a mechanic decrypting these codes to hex...thats not good news for us


[9/30/2025 6:47 PM] mrhoofer
Nothing unnatural would be possible


[9/30/2025 6:50 PM] autorune
why not


[9/30/2025 6:55 PM] 1dispo
this is what I’ve been thinking


[9/30/2025 6:55 PM] 1dispo
and why brute forcing has actually shown results


[9/30/2025 6:55 PM] 1dispo
we aren’t brute forcing a new weapon we are brute forcing a random drop by tweaking another id


[9/30/2025 6:55 PM] anro_19
i do think that the serial thing is kinda weird if you compare different manufactors


[9/30/2025 6:56 PM] anro_19
give me a moment to pull up


[9/30/2025 6:58 PM] mrhoofer
We ran into the same thing with elden ring nightreign vs any other dark souls game. Could be the new norm

i need more crit serials


[9/30/2025 6:59 PM] anro_19
i used the random shit and attached jacobs sub stuff and it give me gun and crit


[9/30/2025 6:59 PM] mrhoofer
Its so simple, just a double encryption. We can try all we want, but if this is the case 2+2 has to =4 or else


[9/30/2025 6:59 PM] anro_19
so there are several serial which does the same thing


[9/30/2025 7:00 PM] mrhoofer
But nothing illegal


[9/30/2025 7:00 PM] anro_19
Gun + Crit => O<4D-Qq


[9/30/2025 7:01 PM] 1dispo
yea this is what im seeing too


[9/30/2025 7:01 PM] anro_19
can be added to multiple enhacement if you replace the correct one i did test it out with random enhacement stuff i had and it worked always


[9/30/2025 7:01 PM] 1dispo
nothing illegal possible at all


[9/30/2025 7:01 PM] akamoden
don't forget that weapons are compiled mainly of different parts. and stats are tied to these parts. barrels, scopes, stock, magazine. and each part has stats tied to it.


[9/30/2025 7:01 PM] 1dispo
checked against a bank


[9/30/2025 7:02 PM] anro_19
time to farm for sniper damage and crit damage 🤣


[9/30/2025 7:02 PM] 1dispo
the devs probably only wanted a certain degree of freedom with the system in all fairness


[9/30/2025 7:02 PM] akamoden
thats why sheilds and gernades can be modified so easily. because they are flat stats. they don't tie stats to the model.


[9/30/2025 7:02 PM] 1dispo
hmmm


[9/30/2025 7:02 PM] anro_19
maybe the game does ignore invalid combination as so long its in the pull itself


[9/30/2025 7:02 PM] 1dispo
that’s why ppl have had enhancements flying out already?


[9/30/2025 7:02 PM] akamoden
yeah.


[9/30/2025 7:03 PM] anro_19
it wouldnt be a big suprise for me either when you have 2 identical enhacement and there still have a different serial at the end


[9/30/2025 7:04 PM] anro_19
well time to grab some sniper stuff and build the ultimative order and hat trick enhacement 🤓


[9/30/2025 7:04 PM] akamoden
you can only assemble a gun with valid parts. hence why modded guns are missing textures. i think theres some leeway here though as it will let you but i don't think the gun is functioning properly. even with all the legendaries added on.


[9/30/2025 7:04 PM] anro_19
Enhacement and Grenades are a lot easier to understand then weapons


[9/30/2025 7:05 PM] akamoden
ya cause they don't have stats tied to thier models. or weapon parts.


[9/30/2025 7:05 PM] akamoden
just static numbers.


[9/30/2025 7:06 PM] anro_19
well sure gonna take propably a couple of weeks until the first working editor comes out


[9/30/2025 7:06 PM] anro_19
or with other words for human readable editors


[9/30/2025 7:07 PM] akamoden
most information about a parts list is only present at runtime. if we got that. it'd be alot easier to min max guns or select parts we wante.d


[9/30/2025 7:07 PM] anro_19
well i have no clue about this stuff as im not a debugger


[9/30/2025 7:08 PM] akamoden
me niether. i've combed the dump and combed the .NCS files. and we just need the parts list.


[9/30/2025 7:09 PM] akamoden

[9/30/2025 7:13 PM] anro_19
what kind of id do you look for?


[9/30/2025 7:16 PM] 1dispo
specifically acey may with jakobs crit and kinetic

at this point tho id take any roll of stats any level and any element


[9/30/2025 7:16 PM] akamoden
might be one of those locked legendaries.


[9/30/2025 7:17 PM] akamoden
locked to just kinetic, can't roll jakobs. but who knows.


[9/30/2025 7:17 PM] akamoden
go grab we mod and farm drill sites for the roll you want


[9/30/2025 7:18 PM] 1dispo

[9/30/2025 7:18 PM] 1dispo

i think ur on the right path tbh


[9/30/2025 7:18 PM] anro_19
getting a god roll fisheye is kinda stupid 🤣


[9/30/2025 7:18 PM] 1dispo
i didn’t find a jakobs in a long bit of farming


[9/30/2025 7:18 PM] 1dispo
but to be fair I wasn’t just looking for acey may so maybe my attention was split


[9/30/2025 7:19 PM] 1dispo
i was notably missing a few rolls after a short amt of farming, not enough to say it doesn’t roll but enough to be suspicious


[9/30/2025 7:19 PM] 1dispo
my focus wasn’t on acey in particular


[9/30/2025 7:19 PM] 1dispo
but when I did it didn’t show


[9/30/2025 7:19 PM] 1dispo
so I just don’t know


[9/30/2025 7:19 PM] akamoden
yeah. i'd go try to farm again.


[9/30/2025 7:20 PM] 1dispo
i will tonight, for context I’ve been working on my laptop with the actual data rather than farming the last day, im finally getting home tonight so ill be able to test

You'll all get there eventually. Ive seen this before. Even offline, the double encryption will always throw an error


[9/30/2025 7:21 PM] akamoden
what is this double encryption?


[9/30/2025 7:21 PM] 1dispo
what do you suggest? given you seem fairly knowledgeable on hex


[9/30/2025 7:22 PM] 1dispo
in twrms of next step for a specific gun and part


[9/30/2025 7:22 PM] mrhoofer
The only thing I can see being super useful is class mods with extra points


[9/30/2025 7:22 PM] 1dispo
hoofer made a good point that the codes we see are likely double encrypted for sanity


[9/30/2025 7:22 PM] 1dispo
more extensive of checks than we thought


[9/30/2025 7:23 PM] mrhoofer
@Ugd_t@FmgaYQH5I6p&s=Q^%4~ZHK<Gg                                 

These things. Console save files are compiled in hex. There has you be like a Rosetta stone that decodes the weird strings to hex


[9/30/2025 7:23 PM] akamoden
could you give me an example of why we think this?


[9/30/2025 7:23 PM] mrhoofer
Bl4 being crossplay...pc probably works the same

what its really good and remind me of my favorit sniper rifle the EBR 100 🤓


[9/30/2025 7:23 PM] 1dispo
yes I get that but I mean more what would be my next step to get a sample of acey mays to lead into being able to make an acey may with an added part from jakobs


[9/30/2025 7:24 PM] 1dispo
hoofer would have to explain, I get what his point is but as im trying to type it out it makes less and less sense LOL


[9/30/2025 7:25 PM] mrhoofer
My best shot at explaining

sigh this is all confusing


[9/30/2025 7:25 PM] akamoden
hex and bytes line up.


[9/30/2025 7:26 PM] mrhoofer
Proto has already made a hex decryption tool


[9/30/2025 7:26 PM] 1dispo
Maybe double encrypting just isn’t the right term for it


[9/30/2025 7:27 PM] akamoden
hex isnt a encryption.....


[9/30/2025 7:27 PM] mrhoofer
Yea maybe not the right term. A cypher?


[9/30/2025 7:28 PM] akamoden
i can live with that.


[9/30/2025 7:28 PM] mrhoofer
Imagine those rings in 90s cereal boxes. You needed the ring to read the hidden message


[9/30/2025 7:28 PM] mrhoofer
Maybe im too old😂

[9/30/2025 7:28 PM] akamoden
we can already break the strings down into hex and bytes.


[9/30/2025 7:28 PM] 1dispo
idk what these performance complaints are this shit works amazingly


[9/30/2025 7:28 PM] 1dispo
wonderful


[9/30/2025 7:28 PM] mrhoofer
Just the fact you can or need to do this proves my point


[9/30/2025 7:29 PM] 1dispo
okay wait I seem to have actually made some progress ? not what im intending tho?


[9/30/2025 7:29 PM] 1dispo
I have reliably gotten it to make unique acey mays


[9/30/2025 7:29 PM] 1dispo
None of them missed


[9/30/2025 7:29 PM] 1dispo
but none of them were jakobs parts


[9/30/2025 7:29 PM] mrhoofer
"Mods" are only really edited legal items. And thats all that'll be possible


[9/30/2025 7:29 PM] 1dispo
different parts but not what I need


[9/30/2025 7:29 PM] 1dispo

[9/30/2025 7:30 PM] akamoden
you mean the engine does the same thing we do?


[9/30/2025 7:30 PM] 1dispo
well it’s something ig


[9/30/2025 7:30 PM] akamoden
thats only one wall of encoding.


[9/30/2025 7:30 PM] akamoden
one encode.


[9/30/2025 7:31 PM] mrhoofer
But anything we edit illegally won't match the cypher and will error in some way. If a roll/part whatever doesn't exist...we cant add it


[9/30/2025 7:31 PM] akamoden
bro. thats not... you're right but describing it in such a complicated way. i just said this too. we need the parts list. i explained the whole thing.


[9/30/2025 7:32 PM] mrhoofer
I dont know the specifics for BL4 but I know ive run into this issue with other recent games


[9/30/2025 7:32 PM] akamoden
in just how their 30 billion guns work.


[9/30/2025 7:32 PM] akamoden
they need a robust system to produce 30 billion guns without hardcoding them all.


[9/30/2025 7:32 PM] akamoden
and thats what we have to deal with.


[9/30/2025 7:33 PM] akamoden
we would need to hook at runtime to produce illegal items, to allow the sytem to give us silly weapons.


[9/30/2025 7:33 PM] mrhoofer
We just gotta hope people get bored with using the same build and they change the loot system back


[9/30/2025 7:34 PM] mrhoofer
Correct. But when you log in...


[9/30/2025 7:34 PM] akamoden
when we log in


[9/30/2025 7:34 PM] akamoden
go onj


[9/30/2025 7:35 PM] akamoden
theres no extra wall we need to cross. no extra encode. nothing. its just a set of rules. does this weapon belong with this part. does this barrel belong with this stock. etc. nothing else.


[9/30/2025 7:36 PM] mrhoofer
I dont think that's right because we can swap parts/rolls around.


[9/30/2025 7:36 PM] mrhoofer
We just cant edit the rolls themselves


[9/30/2025 7:37 PM] akamoden
thats cause they pack the Bytes


[9/30/2025 7:37 PM] akamoden
you need to change the whole block, to change one thing. and thats why taking blocks and chunks works.


[9/30/2025 7:39 PM] anro_19
very interessting that the Gun + Crit does not work on order Enhacements 🤓

not byte for byte unfortunatly.

or i mean base85 is not equal to 1 byte.

sometimes you apply firmware and the entire thing change fully

has a different pool, so you can't infer that changing 
=une-9 is = to firmware.


[9/30/2025 8:58 PM] akamoden
only the same length same blocks, can be used to determine what is the firmware.


[9/30/2025 8:58 PM] akamoden
silly.

ya


[9/30/2025 9:02 PM] copeconsumer
Lets just talk about how its interesting how firmware does in fact sometimes change only one to two characters but sometimes changes entire strings its fascinating


[9/30/2025 9:03 PM] 1dispo
everyone wants to figure this out


[9/30/2025 9:03 PM] 1dispo
same goal


[9/30/2025 9:03 PM] 1dispo
i am so confused why firmware is that much easier tho


[9/30/2025 9:04 PM] copeconsumer

@Alien Was making funny enhancements i would ask them about how they were doing that


[9/30/2025 9:05 PM] 1dispo
Allen seems to have a rlly good grip of the single part items


[9/30/2025 9:05 PM] 1dispo
More than anyone else


[9/30/2025 9:06 PM] anro_19
but yeah digging more in it shifting the length will do a lot more i wonder why it only affects firmware but the sub effects 🤔

i still dunno how to do that


[9/30/2025 9:21 PM] anro_19
editing items in runtime kinda crash the game 😢

I believe its through a console command enabler


[9/30/2025 9:25 PM] anro_19
so if you know which byte is for firmware which is then for sub stats?


[9/30/2025 9:27 PM] akamoden
i can find out with a bit of testing.


[9/30/2025 9:27 PM] akamoden
give me a sec


[9/30/2025 9:27 PM] anro_19
that would be a lot easier


[9/30/2025 9:29 PM] anro_19
then you could techniqually compare 2 enhacement and apply what needed


[9/30/2025 9:29 PM] akamoden
yeah could you link that maliwane that was similar to the jakobs?


[9/30/2025 9:30 PM] anro_19

[9/30/2025 9:40 PM] madladtrav
how do you get an item code from something?


[9/30/2025 9:40 PM] anro_19
Cheat Engine


[9/30/2025 9:40 PM] 1dispo
various ways but ur probably looking for exporting a save file and reading it through yaml or cheat engine


[9/30/2025 9:40 PM] copeconsumer
Either through direct Yaml examination or through a cheat table that has the ability to see it


[9/30/2025 9:40 PM] 1dispo
^


[9/30/2025 9:40 PM] akamoden
its fine i've blocked him. i obv can't not react.


[9/30/2025 9:40 PM] akamoden
sorry boys.


[9/30/2025 9:40 PM] 1dispo
all good that’s a solution


[9/30/2025 9:41 PM] madladtrav
is there a tutorial on this or someone who could explain it all to me sometime? would love to help out


[9/30/2025 9:41 PM] copeconsumer
Its okay, sometimes people cant be friends and just not interacting with eachother is a better option


[9/30/2025 9:41 PM] anro_19
i would say Cheat Engine is a lot easier as you can select a item directly


[9/30/2025 9:42 PM] 1dispo
you wouldn’t need a tutorial for save method, just go to documents, my games, go down the rabbit hole until you get to your steam id, then there are your save files, which you can put in a variety of host websites or exes to edit/see the data


[9/30/2025 9:42 PM] 1dispo
cheat engine you’d need a tutorial if u don’t know


[9/30/2025 9:43 PM] madladtrav
what do we do with these codes then? like how can I mess around and do trial and error to try and mod something?


[9/30/2025 9:43 PM] anro_19
pretty much trial and error at the moment


[9/30/2025 9:44 PM] madladtrav
correct but what do i use to do it


[9/30/2025 9:44 PM] anro_19
as none of the tools provide any usefull information so far so its pretty much a guessing right now.


[9/30/2025 9:44 PM] anro_19
You can use any Save Game Editor to mess around with stuff


[9/30/2025 9:44 PM] madladtrav
ah ok


[9/30/2025 9:44 PM] anro_19
or use the RAW Gun Editor and the Add Item from nexusmods


[9/30/2025 9:45 PM] madladtrav
didnt even see the raw gun editor last i looked on nexus. must of missed it


[9/30/2025 9:46 PM] anro_19
well it dosent do really much anything useful as bytes has been documented so you could mess a little easier with things


[9/30/2025 9:46 PM] spytor
Question, when looking through the items people are sharing, how do you know if it's modded item or not?


[9/30/2025 9:47 PM] anro_19
if it has things it shouldnt has like more stats or to many skill points or multiple legendary effects things like this


[9/30/2025 9:48 PM] spytor
ah okay thanks

By swapping individual bits, I'm able to figure out where are the six bits governing the level and change them freely.
If there was a checksum, this would not work.


[10/1/2025 4:50 AM] nicnl
Well I also bitswapped a SMG from purple to blue and green
```

however I was unable to bitswap it to common/white


[10/1/2025 4:54 AM] nicnl
I managed to get a white GCX without perks from the weapon shop:
```

WHITE:   8060d084220e4609fa0c840c5a87ea8b353aa3d4b50b9507010f350e
                         ^
```

It seems to have a `f`  in place of the`0/1/2` that governs the rarity of the Aramid GCX


[10/1/2025 4:55 AM] nicnl
However, if I take the purple GCX (with a `2`) and swap it to a `f`
It instantly becomes corrupted, doesn't appear in the inventory, and ends up in "unknown items"


[10/1/2025 4:55 AM] nicnl
So


[10/1/2025 4:55 AM] nicnl
The rarity does seem to change the layout


[10/1/2025 4:57 AM] nicnl
Observations:
- "Colored" weapons (purple/blue/green) seems to share the same layout?
- Common weapons (white) have a different, smaller, layout?


[10/1/2025 5:02 AM] copeconsumer
Do legendaries also share a similar rarity layout?


[10/1/2025 5:03 AM] nicnl
Not sure, I haven't checked yet


[10/1/2025 5:03 AM] nicnl
Do you know if there is a legendary GCX?


[10/1/2025 5:04 AM] nicnl
It's kinda tricky to know because most legendaries have a unique name, despite being similar to standard items


[10/1/2025 5:09 AM] whiteshark2020
is it figured out how to change elements?

Working with Birts bee was able to generate fire/kinetic,fire/corrosive, fire/cryo however adding shock in place of fire either deleted the weapon only locked in shock or made it fully kinetic

hex content for the variants
note: i did a second bitswap (on the right) on the corrosive, it gave it higher DPS for some reason
but it's definitely the first swap that governs the elemental type

Yeah the legendary is called frangible and it’s randomized to the point of you don’t know if its good or not until you try it


[10/1/2025 7:53 AM] jernau6749
I wonder if we can add the missing parts to the one from before?


[10/1/2025 7:53 AM] nicnl
when I say "not legendary", I mean "it's purple so the game doesn't classify it as orange/legendary"

expectedly, bitswapping gives better results than randomizing with the raw base85

You’re gaining more progress


[10/1/2025 7:55 AM] nicnl
this is because a single character from the base85 can overlaps two different bytes, meaning the results are unpredictable

There's no gui, they're raw dog javascript files


[10/1/2025 8:19 AM] nicnl
`bitswap.js` is a file that :
1) decodes a serial to hex
2) bitswap every bit position
3) serialize to hex
4) prints is to yaml, allowing to paste it directly into a save


[10/1/2025 8:19 AM] whiteshark2020

[10/1/2025 8:20 AM] mrhoofer
would it help if everything was in hex?


[10/1/2025 8:20 AM] whiteshark2020
also i dunno if you have modded bl3 but weapons need mags, some dont for unlimited ammo


[10/1/2025 8:21 AM] nicnl
and the big problem is : stuff seems to be moving around
depending on the weapon type (and even rarity), the bytes that governs the stats (level/grip/scope/etc) are at different positions


[10/1/2025 8:22 AM] whiteshark2020
they revamped it but its prolly same loguc build as before


[10/1/2025 8:23 AM] nicnl
I guess?
base85 has a nasty side effect: a single base85 character can overlap the data of two different bytes
it's harder to analyze what happens because:
- a single bit/byte being changed will change multiple base85 characters
- changing a single base85 character can simultaneously modify bit and bytes at different positions
and I don't think we want any of those two things from happening


[10/1/2025 8:23 AM] mrhoofer
i know of a program that decodes serials to hex. happy to share if itd help

i would guess it's a game balance issue
since shock has an advantage only on enemy shields, they increased shock DMG to balance it out?

not sure

Yeah I think you're right, looking at the other rolls I got while trying to farm it the damage seems to line up. So it must be a Radiation thing

- Good news: the values are the same between the two weapons
  - `0x9  =  0b1001` for fire
  - `0xd  =  0b1101` for shock
  - `0x5  =  0b0101` for corrosion
- Bad news: they're at different positions

From your findings is it possible to make a birts bees without the bees but keeping its high fire rate or is the barrel code for the legendary connected to the fire rate?

typically for bytestrings, you want to look at the thing per byte not per char
in this case, its `0x15` for corrosive, not `0x5`

because i'm surprised the cryo "pattern" is so long


[10/1/2025 10:59 AM] adozon
you can ignore rest of them , because i confirmed sNQ77 is fragment of cryo . and  lsG&o sG&lS 、 shock and corrosive


[10/1/2025 11:00 AM] adozon
those can swappable with sNQ77


[10/1/2025 11:00 AM] nicnl
working directly with base85 fragments is unreliable

i want to pinpoint the exact bit position in the hex string


[10/1/2025 11:02 AM] adozon
maybe bit position is moving in each case by encoding somehow i guess . thats why those 3 patterns of cryo exsist . and some perk can be swappable .

1) its base element
2) the accessory magazine that swaps to the second element

maybe next thing is establith method of writing and how to close flagment of perk . i havent reach . how did you do that ?

[10/1/2025 11:21 AM] autorune
this still doesn't sit right with me, as that alone isn't decodable in b85 as it needs to be multiples of 4 characters. so its definitely looking like some kind of bit packing going on

Three bit flips to go from cryo/corrosive to cryo/radiation
From `0x8 = 0b1000` to `0x6 = 0b0110`

im wondering if the parts decodes to something like
```
"parts": [
  [partType, idRef],
  [partType, idRef],
  [partType, idRef],
]
```


[10/1/2025 11:33 AM] nicnl
Yes I think it's linked to the barrel


[10/1/2025 11:33 AM] wetillusions
Yes, I have one in my backpack. Should be a code in here for it


[10/1/2025 11:34 AM] nicnl
it is very annoying because, this time, the elemental flip bits were at the end


[10/1/2025 11:34 AM] nicnl
whereas on the other weapons it was around the center of the serial


[10/1/2025 11:35 AM] adozon
yap I confirmed some case works some case doesnt about swapping.
but breaking certain point of serial breaks certain "elements" in each.
for example weapon element is hidden in 5letters after "RG" in common case of kickballer


[10/1/2025 11:36 AM] d_
this one decodes to something odd:

it's just that you're working with byte alignment whereas i'm not


[10/1/2025 11:38 AM] nicnl
but yeah the repeating pattern is very odd


[10/1/2025 11:39 AM] nicnl
knowing that:
- the elemental bits are moving around (sometimes in the middle, sometimes at the end)
- there are repeating patterns (`41` and `a`)


[10/1/2025 11:39 AM] nicnl
are they encoding sub-blocks of known length, identified with a prefix or sepatator?


[10/1/2025 11:40 AM] nicnl
it would explain why the elemental bits are "allowed" to move around


[10/1/2025 11:41 AM] nicnl
it would also explain the gigantic-long serials with stupid DPS found in the section "modded items":

[10/1/2025 11:42 AM] nicnl
a guess is that those OP weapons are containing multiple different accessories, but the UI doesn't list them past three or four


[10/1/2025 11:47 AM] nicnl
another theory is that the accessories are managed and stored as arrays
it also explains the long OP weapons... but then back to the original question: why are the bits moving around FFS


[10/1/2025 11:59 AM] anro_19
maybe the part itself shift things around


[10/1/2025 12:00 PM] anro_19
like body = bodya = clip = clipa


[10/1/2025 12:00 PM] anro_19
maybe it store default and variation


[10/1/2025 12:04 PM] autorune
i said this multiple times today haha


[10/1/2025 12:05 PM] autorune
most likely a header somewhere stating the size too


[10/1/2025 12:05 PM] nicnl
You think the size is stored inside as well?


[10/1/2025 12:05 PM] autorune
in the item's header quite likely


[10/1/2025 12:05 PM] autorune
else it won't be able to decode the stats and mod data further down


[10/1/2025 12:06 PM] autorune
since its possible to have multiple barrels and such, we probably have an array  of array, unless the items db is a flat map that contains something like
"mailwan_barrel_a", "torgue_magazine_a"


[10/1/2025 12:07 PM] nicnl
I've always though BL4 is assuming a known fixed size for each blocks, but, why not


[10/1/2025 12:07 PM] nicnl
Should be "easy" to check


[10/1/2025 12:42 PM] autorune

[10/1/2025 12:51 PM] anro_19
well i figured out how to reliable build relics at this point. Or at least merging things with the same name


[10/1/2025 1:01 PM] nicnl
oooh cool
how?


[10/1/2025 1:02 PM] anro_19
Relics with share the same prefix always ends at the same length


[10/1/2025 1:02 PM] anro_19
so as so long you have 2 same times you could merge sub stats


[10/1/2025 1:02 PM] nicnl
always, like, always _always_?


[10/1/2025 1:02 PM] anro_19
yeah


[10/1/2025 1:04 PM] anro_19
i have collect now like 20 different Order Evolve Relics there always share the same code ```@Ugr$rIm/)}}!c@JWNWCv7s8Ex```  so anything after the x define the sub stats


[10/1/2025 1:07 PM] anro_19
the rule also apply to all other relics so far there always share the same code until a certain point

 54 characters
its base-85 which means 4 characters is 3 bytes.
(54/4)*3 = 40.5 bytes


[10/1/2025 1:27 PM] autorune
if we skip the @U, 39 bytes

[10/1/2025 4:55 PM] autorune
this im already aware of, but again, isn't totally accurate because its almost certainly doing some stuff with bit packing (eg protobuf)


[10/1/2025 4:56 PM] autorune
yes, im trying to find stuff like array lengths (eg for parts)


[10/1/2025 4:56 PM] autorune
it needs those, otherwise it wont know where to start reading stats etc


[10/1/2025 4:56 PM] s4mzy.
the blue part i need to tweak


[10/1/2025 4:57 PM] s4mzy.
as that part also holds the rarity


[10/1/2025 4:57 PM] autorune
thats interesting, i'd have thought it to be in the header


[10/1/2025 4:57 PM] s4mzy.
nah


[10/1/2025 4:58 PM] autorune
also theory that its a sum of parts that determines rarity


[10/1/2025 4:58 PM] s4mzy.
in that example it could be from the pj to the U)


[10/1/2025 5:06 PM] autorune
which is only part of a valid base85 quartet


[10/1/2025 5:07 PM] autorune
which means rarity could technically be represented anywhere between 3 and 24 bits (5 rarities with 2 upcoming, so we want a max value of 7 at least)


[10/1/2025 5:08 PM] anro_19

"please only deliver me one serial at a time in the afformentioned format"


[10/1/2025 5:54 PM] mattmab
or how ever many you want


[10/1/2025 5:54 PM] itsrghd
Breaking down these files of 100 birts bees it made 2 hybrids. However it turned them into just the barrel and no gu


[10/1/2025 5:55 PM] mattmab
thats why i was generating 10000 it generally loads like 1200 items into game


[10/1/2025 5:55 PM] mattmab
and say 200 are just crap and 800 are identical and 200 are interesting in some way


[10/1/2025 5:55 PM] itsrghd
So with that method it can format the file to yaml and i convert to sav?


[10/1/2025 5:56 PM] mattmab
the .yaml it produces contains just the inventory items


[10/1/2025 5:56 PM] mattmab
you need to use a save editor like i mentioned in the post and paste them in the inventory


[10/1/2025 5:57 PM] itsrghd
Got it.


[10/1/2025 8:07 PM] autorune
example of my editor atm (the algo is wrong tho)

example is swapping the two hot sluggers from earlier:
```

Level 46:  @Ugd_t@FkTR0Y)(*ERH1&NdZON-VxdwZ00

```

this is the reason i got people to follow that new format in the item channels so then databases can involve them and help isolate stats and everything that would be helpful to know

Zero accessories, zero perks


[10/1/2025 9:09 PM] nicnl
Just very comparable stats overall


[10/1/2025 9:10 PM] nicnl
I would have expected those weapons to have an almost mirror-like structure, except with a dozens bit (not byte) difference


[10/1/2025 9:10 PM] s4mzy.
reload speeds are different


[10/1/2025 9:10 PM] nicnl
Yeah


[10/1/2025 9:10 PM] s4mzy.
put them to the same level and see if there dps is the same


[10/1/2025 9:11 PM] nicnl
The dps is probably not going to be same level

Visually there are a few different parts


[10/1/2025 9:11 PM] nicnl
However I can reasonably isolate the parts byte and change them out


[10/1/2025 9:11 PM] nicnl
They're around the first third of the item iirc


[10/1/2025 9:13 PM] d_
I think we can reasonably assume that that's where the length difference comes from, but like you mentioned earlier, I would have also expected that there would otherwise be minimal differences in the bits


[10/1/2025 9:14 PM] nicnl
i should try experimenting with those two


[10/1/2025 9:14 PM] nicnl
turn one into another, byte per byte


[10/1/2025 9:14 PM] nicnl

[10/1/2025 9:17 PM] nicnl
in their current state, they do share a simular structure

--------------------

This one changed the magazine to a "semi-invalid" one.  (blue is the only change I made)
I say "semi-invalid" because the weapon DOES work.   It has a lower reload time + a large amount of ammo.
There is no reload animation (nothing happens visually) but the ammo IS getting reloaded after the indicated duration.
Judging by the fast reload speed + big size => I guess it's referencing the magazine of another weapon type?

again, injecting base85 is unreliable because multiple characters affect multiple non-aligned bytes

What do you think should be tried


[10/1/2025 10:44 PM] nicnl
decoding the serial from base85 to hex


[10/1/2025 10:44 PM] nicnl
then modify whatever you want in the hex


[10/1/2025 10:44 PM] nicnl
and turn it back to base85


[10/1/2025 10:45 PM] nicnl
basically it's the same you already do, but you won't have the nasty side-effects of the base85 serials in which changing a single character can actually change other unwanted stuff

I transposed most of the hex from the green onto the white.
However I could not transpose the three orange hex-digits => it stopped the weapon from spawning
On the experimental merge, the result if all fucked up, most of the components are missing for some reason

Spread launcher

is there a version without any underbarrel?


[10/2/2025 1:32 AM] nicnl
i wonder if the tail you isolated is the entire underbarrel

however the spread launcher is not


[10/2/2025 1:43 AM] nicnl
i'd have prefered if the "no underbarrel" was in fact the shorter hex


[10/2/2025 1:43 AM] nicnl
but no


[10/2/2025 1:43 AM] nicnl
:PES5_DistortYikes:


[10/2/2025 1:44 AM] thatdonfc
Just added another one that is shorter with no underbarrel


[10/2/2025 1:44 AM] nicnl
oh


[10/2/2025 1:45 AM] nicnl
```
2a162a142502
02162a14
```
suspiciously similar as well... but longer for some reason?


[10/2/2025 1:46 AM] thatdonfc
`162a14` is at he end of both of them


[10/2/2025 1:46 AM] nicnl
however, there is interesting to notice

[10/2/2025 1:46 AM] nicnl
the longer version has 4 additional digits


[10/2/2025 1:46 AM] nicnl
so, does this mean the "hint" for the additional digits is un the `2a` instead of the `02`? (it feels like a bad hunch though)


[10/2/2025 1:52 AM] nicnl
they're not 100% similar, but really close

and the two "no underbarrel" are different, both from the knife launcher and from themselves


[10/2/2025 5:26 AM] anro_19
hmm interessting if you merge 2 serial by starting from last point you can transfer the statistic easily as so long there have the same serial length. Worked so far for like 6 relics for me

[10/2/2025 9:01 AM] nicnl
I'm not surprised
Items with the same length have a high chance of sharing the exact same structure
So transferring stuff from one onto another have high chances of working


[10/2/2025 9:02 AM] anro_19
yeah this works really well so far

i have such a high damage on it but no jakobs 😢


[10/2/2025 9:05 AM] anro_19
the only sniper which can one hit without abusing crit knife


[10/2/2025 9:05 AM] nicnl
Well


[10/2/2025 9:05 AM] nicnl
It depends what you want to achieve


[10/2/2025 9:06 AM] nicnl
For now, I don't think we figured out the layout of the items


[10/2/2025 9:07 AM] nicnl
We know there are a list of parts/accessories near the center/end
But items with different length have this data misaligned from one another


[10/2/2025 9:07 AM] nicnl
And when I say misaligned, i'm not talking about byte pos but BIT pos, which screams bitpacking/varints and whatnot


[10/2/2025 9:07 AM] nicnl
If you want to add the jakobs accessory, well, I'm not sure how


[10/2/2025 9:08 AM] nicnl
However if you want to replace an existing accessory with the jakobs crits... i think it's already doable


[10/2/2025 9:08 AM] anro_19
you know what actually would helps having a mod which could define what we wanna have in the loot pooll


[10/2/2025 9:08 AM] anro_19
oh yeah i can build relics for jakobs myself with no issues


[10/2/2025 9:09 AM] nicnl
Does your fisheye have an unwanted perk?


[10/2/2025 9:09 AM] anro_19
no just a missing one


[10/2/2025 9:09 AM] nicnl
eh


[10/2/2025 9:09 AM] anro_19
unclear what the weapon can have actually

[10/2/2025 9:10 AM] nicnl
"impact instead of sticky"
it's doable by bitswapping back and fourth


[10/2/2025 9:10 AM] thedarkness1404
im trying to add and change the 2nd stat on it


[10/2/2025 9:11 AM] fayed_dream98
I can’t make it work 😅 if someone manages to make it happen please ping me as I’ll be off to bed really soon my eyes are burning from looking at code


[10/2/2025 9:11 AM] thedarkness1404
with gun damage and crit damage on it bc it already has sniper dmg in it


[10/2/2025 9:12 AM] nicnl
Most likely: you (or the person who pasted the code) has mangled it due to special characters
Discord uses underscores `_` and stars `*` for italic and bold, and the backquotes for quotes


[10/2/2025 9:12 AM] anro_19
i could build a jakobs relic with sniper stuff if somebody drop me relics for it 🤣


[10/2/2025 9:12 AM] thedarkness1404
i even used cheat engines one


[10/2/2025 9:12 AM] nicnl
But again, it's when they have the same length?


[10/2/2025 9:13 AM] anro_19
which there have if there have the same pre and suf


[10/2/2025 9:13 AM] nicnl
That always the big problematic if


[10/2/2025 9:13 AM] nicnl
:WorryEyes:


[10/2/2025 9:13 AM] anro_19
as so long the relics share the identical name i can merge stats as i want


[10/2/2025 9:13 AM] anro_19
relics with identical names always have the same length


[10/2/2025 9:14 AM] thedarkness1404
its the one shot undead class mod for the siren


[10/2/2025 9:14 AM] nicnl
identical name... and rarity I guess?


[10/2/2025 9:14 AM] anro_19
there always legendary 🤔


[10/2/2025 9:14 AM] nicnl
by comparison the white and a green jakobs snipers with the same exact name don't have the same length


[10/2/2025 9:14 AM] anro_19
there only need identical name which is prefix and suffix


[10/2/2025 9:15 AM] anro_19
talking here about legendary


[10/2/2025 9:15 AM] nicnl
ok ok


[10/2/2025 9:15 AM] nicnl
makes sense


[10/2/2025 9:15 AM] anro_19
but should be no different to  purple ones actually


[10/2/2025 9:15 AM] anro_19
the struct at least is for relics always the same there dont shift like there do for weapons

When you paste serials, you need to put three backticks above and under

```
like this
```

if you don't do that, discord breaks your codes, because it interprets your underscores/stars/backquotes as italic/bold/quoting

[10/2/2025 9:23 AM] nicnl
manu?


[10/2/2025 9:23 AM] anro_19
manufactor


[10/2/2025 9:23 AM] anro_19
i dont know what comes first the manufactor or rarity level is third that for sure

i find it somehow weird why the game is even using such a thing 🤔


[10/2/2025 9:33 AM] anro_19
wouldnt it better to use bitmask then having such stupid code?


[10/2/2025 9:35 AM] nicnl
[if] they used an encoding tool such as protobufs (which they did in tiny tina iirc)


[10/2/2025 9:35 AM] nicnl
then the bitpack shit is automatic and part of the lib
the actual borderlands devs may not even be aware of it LMAO


[10/2/2025 9:36 AM] burrmane
thats what ive been doing but for some reason they stopped appearing in game


[10/2/2025 9:36 AM] anro_19
okay because this serial thing being just stupid 🤔


[10/2/2025 9:37 AM] anro_19
welp my knowledge about coding is kinda limited


[10/2/2025 9:37 AM] nicnl
coding is my job


[10/2/2025 9:37 AM] nicnl
and i confirm the serial thing is stupid


[10/2/2025 9:38 AM] nicnl
no sane dev would do this for no reason
- either they actively wanted to obfuscate their stuff
- or it's a side effect of using a protobuf-like tool and they're not aware of it


[10/2/2025 9:38 AM] anro_19
well i speak just about my modding experience where stuff like bitmask makes alot more sense if you want to apply a lot of thing to a object


[10/2/2025 9:38 AM] anro_19
and it remains human understandable


[10/2/2025 9:38 AM] nicnl
i don't think it's for obfuscation though, because if they wanted to fuck us GOOD there would be some kind of checksum


[10/2/2025 9:38 AM] nicnl
and there is none: we can freely manipulate the level and the stats


[10/2/2025 9:39 AM] anro_19
i mean game has some sort of sanity checker at least


[10/2/2025 9:39 AM] nicnl
always


[10/2/2025 9:39 AM] nicnl
when you parse "external" data (aka: serials from a savegame) you always need a fallback when it doesn't decode properly


[10/2/2025 9:40 AM] nicnl
they probably had the problem themselves  when writing the weapon system: serials produces with "old system" probably didn't decode anymore


[10/2/2025 9:40 AM] autorune
they absolutely are aware of the serial stuff, look at how the equipping works. The slot stores the serial and cross references the inventory for an item that's flagged as equipped with the same serial


[10/2/2025 9:40 AM] anro_19
if there really would do hide things there would also add anti cheat


[10/2/2025 9:41 AM] anro_19
or there have a different view on items in there kit 🤔


[10/2/2025 9:43 AM] nicnl

[10/2/2025 9:45 AM] nicnl
That's not what I meant by this
I meant: the serials are base85, we akready know that.  But after decoding to hex, why is it STILL relying on (seemingly) bitpacked data?

Are you restarting the entire game?


[10/2/2025 9:53 AM] anro_19
yeah


[10/2/2025 9:53 AM] anro_19
not interessted in giving my personal information away to website to get the console thingy


[10/2/2025 9:53 AM] nicnl
I figured out: convert the save when going back to the menu
Just continue clicking the convert button during loading
Then you can load in your save and it'll work


[10/2/2025 9:54 AM] anro_19
you also could do it by just loading a other character :


[10/2/2025 9:54 AM] nicnl
Yeah but it's slower, it adds a step


[10/2/2025 9:54 AM] anro_19
each their own at least struct for relics are now clear


[10/2/2025 9:54 AM] anro_19
the only thing is finding starting point of the struct


[10/2/2025 9:55 AM] nicnl
*when sharing the same length
we're able to merge those
but unable to transfer between others


[10/2/2025 9:55 AM] anro_19
you actually can


[10/2/2025 9:56 AM] derder
so after testing 10's of thousands of super soldier shields that I was trying to get the "bundled" mod from the fireworks shield. Occasionally, I would generate a shield with that last stand perk or whatever it's called, and whenever that would happen that shield would get "armor" shield perks including the missle launch from the fireworks shield, so either for Daedelus brand shields the legendary code for bundled is different or you can't combine spcific legendary effects if they missmatch too much? which wouldn't really make sense with all the different legendary effects people are putting on everything


[10/2/2025 9:56 AM] anro_19
i have done this myself just cost me like 60 restarts 🤣


[10/2/2025 9:56 AM] nicnl
that's just bruteforce at this point


[10/2/2025 9:57 AM] derder
that or the third and most likely option is I don't know hot to tell chatGPT how to do things in a smart way


[10/2/2025 9:57 AM] nicnl
well it works, i'm not gonna deny that


[10/2/2025 9:57 AM] anro_19
yeah because where is the start point of the struct part and where it ends


[10/2/2025 9:57 AM] anro_19
that the issues


[10/2/2025 9:57 AM] nicnl
no idea...


[10/2/2025 9:58 AM] anro_19
exactly cost like 20 restart to transfer a sub stat from different named relic


[10/2/2025 9:59 AM] nicnl
was it byte-aligned? or did you have to do bitshifts?


[10/2/2025 9:59 AM] anro_19
bitshift


[10/2/2025 9:59 AM] anro_19
i merged 22 with a 28


[10/2/2025 10:00 AM] anro_19
which turned in to 26 then


[10/2/2025 10:05 AM] nicnl

Question 🙋‍♂️ how did yall stack the damage on that kaoson it looked like you just copied the serial and pasted it on the end but I could be wrong I just woke up


[10/2/2025 10:50 AM] nicnl
no idea, i don't think the guys who make the stacked damage weapons are talking here


[10/2/2025 10:50 AM] nicnl
maybe they want to protect their secret sauce, idk


[10/2/2025 10:51 AM] tfk_yun

I just got into modding yesterday so I’m trying to soak in as much as I can


[10/2/2025 10:52 AM] tfk_yun
But to me it look like they just put a / at the end and looped the code that’s why the more damage the longer it was and it just looked like it was repeating


[10/2/2025 10:54 AM] nicnl
Weapons seems to be constructed in parts and accessories, so yes there are repeating patterns
Now the big issue is that some weapons have different layouts and don't always match each other
And this is where we're stuck


[10/2/2025 10:54 AM] d_
I don't think it needs to be that long to function, it just happened to work


[10/2/2025 10:56 AM] copeconsumer
Yeah it feels like sometimes some weapons are a 4 and others are a 3 and you need another 4 to compare with


[10/2/2025 10:56 AM] tfk_yun
Ok again I just woke up but in my brain I was like maybe it’s got that damage because if the parts are looped it just stacks the damage parts

Okay so here is what I did
1. I took different snipers that shares the same scope
2. I bitshifted them all until the scope changed, the goal being : perform the SAME scope swap across all three snipers


[10/2/2025 11:40 AM] nicnl
Multiple obsevations:
- On sniper 1 and 2, the changed values were identical : from `9` to `d` and `b`
  - But the position is different
- On sniper 3, the required bitshift to change the scope were on **DIFFERENT HEX DIGITS**
  - This is very annoying, yet another proof that there is bitpack shit going on

I kind of want to go and shift each bit and see what changes/breaks on an item to try and find out why some have so much longer sizes.


[10/2/2025 12:07 PM] nicnl
Isn't it a bit risky though?
I mean... bitpacking the weapon level can make sense, they're not gonna do more than 128 levels so that's okay


[10/2/2025 12:07 PM] nicnl
But... weapon scopes? That's the kind of shit they'd add in DLCs, it does not make sense to limit the int size

Bl2 added the gem weapons and pre sequel added glitch weapons but those were a new rarity


[10/2/2025 12:11 PM] orinx
I don’t think 3 did anything besides add new legendary and unique guns


[10/2/2025 12:11 PM] orinx
Bl1 probably added new scopes as the legendary came from the gun parts not a separate slot.


[10/2/2025 12:14 PM] orinx
I wonder if displaying the codes as base 4 would make it easier to spot where all the parts are.

@Nicnl, in your experiment, did you bitswap until the scope changed or did you bitswap the entire serial?
Just to be sure, there is only a single bit responsible for the scope change and not some error recovery.

So apparently same part can sometimes span across bytes. This means they use a bitstream to pack the data. Because even with variable part size, they should be more consistent and not suddenly span across nibbles.
Looking at the hex serials, the very often end with even numbers, which indicates that the last bits are often 0. This happens with bitstreams a lot since the get filled with 0 when they don't end in full bytes. Also some serials end with 00 in hex which would be impossible for parts with 1 byte or bitstreams smaller or equal 8 bit.

Looking at the bitswap experiment the relevant parts are here:
`
b39a9b   101100111001101010011011
839a9a   100000111001101010011010
a0e6a7 101000001110011010100111
             |   max 17 bit  |
`
the look very similar but the last one is shifted by 2 bits. also the maximum length of the bitstream would be 17 bits.

the scope is shifted exactly by 2 bits, which could be a coincidence, but probably is an indication for an even bitstream length.
which leaves us with possible bitstreams of 10, 12, 14, 16 bit.


[10/2/2025 7:29 PM] nicnl
Oh


[10/2/2025 7:29 PM] nicnl

This is absolutely zero-padding going on


[10/2/2025 7:33 PM] inflamedsebi
can we find more hex codes of weapons with this exact scope? (or one of the ones you swapped for)?


[10/2/2025 7:33 PM] nicnl
Well, I can do a couple more
Takes some time, because it required to sift through the 300+ bit swapped serials


[10/2/2025 7:34 PM] inflamedsebi
this would maybe help to get the actual length of the bitstream ...


[10/2/2025 7:34 PM] nicnl
But now I can look at the tail to figure out "good candidates"


[10/2/2025 7:34 PM] inflamedsebi
dont we have a list of sniper rifles with picture?


[10/2/2025 7:35 PM] nicnl
I did a handful of them


[10/2/2025 7:35 PM] inflamedsebi
there is a drive a little bit up ... i just cant figure out which are the scopes called "Top Square Simple" "Side Long Smooth" "Round Square Clear"


[10/2/2025 7:36 PM] nicnl
Ah yes sorry


[10/2/2025 7:36 PM] nicnl
Wait a bit


[10/2/2025 7:36 PM] inflamedsebi
is this side long smooth? xD

[10/2/2025 7:55 PM] inflamedsebi
hmmm. this is weird. I cannot find the scope part in those other codes ...


[10/2/2025 7:55 PM] nicnl
there are a few outliers apparently


[10/2/2025 7:56 PM] nicnl
notably because the are more types of scopes than I thought


[10/2/2025 7:56 PM] inflamedsebi
which means there are more than 1 scope which look like Top Square Simple but are not the same part?


[10/2/2025 7:56 PM] nicnl
in the "side long pointy" they seem to have different mount/attachement

8060E084220E4609CA0D9CCCA1D42A89A1E6A26EA1EEA1F2A0F6A0C221C6A17200 this should be a side long smooth
8060E084220E4609CA0D9CCCA1D42A89A1E6A26EA1EEA1F2A0EEA0C221C6A17200 this should be a round square clear

[10/2/2025 8:10 PM] inflamedsebi
okay so this reduces the bitlength to max 15 bit.

however
for 8060e084220e46092a09e48ca1d42a8d47a8951a43cd43dd6a0caa7d2a172a0e0225aa1c

i cannot find any similar bitsequence on those 2 despite optically the should have the simple scope :/


[10/2/2025 8:11 PM] inflamedsebi
the either have a visual identical but internal different scope or the bitstream theory is wrong 🙁

( it successfully disappears from the save, and reappears identically as before )

this is a completely different bitstream ... not just shifted

:WorryEyes:


[10/2/2025 9:09 PM] inflamedsebi
however maybe parts are not ordered and just get loosely added to a hashmap or any unordered list ... so selling might reorder parts thus completely changing the serial ... but this would not explain why it gets so much longer ...


[10/2/2025 9:10 PM] nicnl
Is it getting marked?
Origin, timestamp, machine, player id, idk


[10/2/2025 9:10 PM] nicnl
Are you getting the same serial as me when buying back?


[10/2/2025 9:10 PM] inflamedsebi
maybe marking and reordering parts that might be it ...

the inka does fit in the bitstream, but it is shifted 1 not 2 ...


[10/2/2025 9:20 PM] inflamedsebi
so the bitstream might be 10 bits long and thus any sniper can have a max of 1024 unique parts inkluding all scopes barrels, bodys, etc ... does 1024 sound plausible?

[10/2/2025 9:23 PM] inflamedsebi
however i cannot figure out why the other inka is so messed up and has 2 bits for scopes so far apart ... maybe thats where error correction kicks in or some weird side effect ...


[10/2/2025 9:24 PM] nicnl
hmmm
so bitswapping found a collision that forced the error correction into "fixing" the scope?


[10/2/2025 9:24 PM] nicnl
there would be two serials with the same scope then, there was just one


[10/2/2025 9:25 PM] inflamedsebi
maybe ... I mean actually we don't know what we are doing at all ... just changing random bits and observe the outcome ...

Would it be possible the decoding from base85 to hex is wrong?
If I use online converter with the same alphabet, I get different hex strings :/


[10/3/2025 1:51 AM] d_
the definitive version is the one decompiled from the game at https://discord.com/channels/1306526445090111508/1418368877183893715/1422390367013048453

[10/3/2025 7:26 AM] kylar_godslayer
are all of the cosmetic pieces the same between them as well? those also affect the code


[10/3/2025 7:50 AM] shirtnoservice
Might have already addressed this and if so, ignore accordingly. Think of the legendary vendor mission where you have to buy items and sell items to move the quest along. I'm guaranteeing that in order for that quest chain to work properly, when an item is bought, it automatically changes the serial to include information that the item was bought so as a form of traceability. Thus it makes sense that the serial changes to include that information that it was bought.


[10/3/2025 7:51 AM] nicnl
Yes and no


[10/3/2025 7:52 AM] nicnl
I'm okay with the vending machine adding some kind of tag/traceability


[10/3/2025 7:52 AM] nicnl
However... why is the resulting serial so vastly different?


[10/3/2025 7:52 AM] nicnl
I would have expected an additional block somewhere, not a completely unique serial


[10/3/2025 7:52 AM] nicnl
This shows yet again that we have much to learn about the item structure


[10/3/2025 7:53 AM] shirtnoservice
Perhaps that's how the game traces buying and selling. You wouldn't notice the sold items serial changing obviously but the bought one for sure as it'd be in your possession afterwards to check ther serial. Have you tried selling and buying back from more than one vendor


[10/3/2025 7:54 AM] shirtnoservice
Maybe each vendor has a unique serial that gets spit out and that's why it chages so drastically


[10/3/2025 7:54 AM] nicnl
Hmmm I didn't


[10/3/2025 7:54 AM] nicnl
Well I did, but the item was already changed


[10/3/2025 7:54 AM] nicnl
And since additional buybacks didn't change it, well


[10/3/2025 7:54 AM] nicnl
I'm gonna try


[10/3/2025 7:55 AM] nicnl
I think we have much to learn by comparing known identical serials


[10/3/2025 7:55 AM] nicnl
We have realiable way to produce mirror serials (except for the additonal tag bit)


[10/3/2025 7:55 AM] nicnl
I think this is good for research


[10/3/2025 7:55 AM] shirtnoservice
Otherwise I don't see how that quest works. It makes you buy specific items like 2 greens and 2 blues and in specific order to trigger the quest chain.


[10/3/2025 7:56 AM] inflamedsebi
So what are we trying?
Selling identical unmodified guns to different vendors?


[10/3/2025 7:57 AM] nicnl
Yes i'm trying that rn


[10/3/2025 7:57 AM] shirtnoservice
I believe so. To see if the vendors spit out unique serials as a result.


[10/3/2025 7:58 AM] inflamedsebi
And maybe reselling a bought back weapon to a different vendor, to see if it changes again?


[10/3/2025 7:58 AM] nicnl
It does not


[10/3/2025 7:59 AM] shirtnoservice
Which indicates that once the item has a 'bought' indicator, it doesn't get removed when selling and buying back.


[10/3/2025 7:59 AM] inflamedsebi
And it might not track whicj vendor at all


[10/3/2025 8:00 AM] shirtnoservice
Correct but if it does, the unique serial makes a lot more sense.


[10/3/2025 8:02 AM] inflamedsebi
My guess was the order of parts might change due to sorting or something and thus changing the whole seed, but to confirm we would need to be able to differentiate parts in the serial…

[10/3/2025 8:08 AM] inflamedsebi
Can we take one of the good reliable bitswap snipers, sell them to change the seed and do a bitswap on them again?
If the bought back weapon has the same scope behavier, then before, just at a different position, we might get some insight …

[10/3/2025 10:22 AM] inflamedsebi
looking at the differences in regards of added data, it seems buying adds 2 -3 bytes. Explicitly if the serial end with 00 (meaning padding) it adds only 2 bytes, since there is storage unmused in the original but, having an unpadded serial adds 3 bytes and apparently it is padded afterwards.
Which means buying adds to the bitstream with about 17-23 bit (maybe 20?).

when you bitswaped the scopes of the sniper, did you by accident see an other obvious change? Like barrel / mag, whatever?


[10/3/2025 10:24 AM] nicnl
A lot yes
A few stables:


[10/3/2025 10:25 AM] nicnl
Rarity (from purple to blue and green) seemed stable (no reserialization)


[10/3/2025 10:25 AM] nicnl
Switched parts or accessories


[10/3/2025 10:26 AM] nicnl
But 80% of them were broken: missing parts, broken stuff overall


[10/3/2025 10:26 AM] hex2021
Anyone good with fire rate / mag size? have a 500k+ plasma coil im trying to get to shoot faster / bigger mag.

if we find a stable change near the scope left and right, we might can determine where the scope starts and ends, thus figuring out its bit size?

I guess

When u sell and buy back what’s the main thing that changes only the price right ?


[10/3/2025 10:53 AM] nicnl
I don't think the price changes


[10/3/2025 10:53 AM] nicnl
in-game, they're perfectly identical in every way possible

{Reactions}
🫡

[10/3/2025 10:54 AM] nicnl
well this is why they're so interesting to compare!

{Reactions}
💯

[10/3/2025 10:55 AM] whodisisg
Yeah that’s strange in most games the price would drop 

That’s interesting so it’s just pulling different codes for the same exact item and duplicating it with different codes


[10/3/2025 10:55 AM] nicnl
important detail: it's changing the code for a **longer** one


[10/3/2025 10:56 AM] nicnl
so the main theory is that buying weapons from a vending machines "flags" them in some way


[10/3/2025 10:57 AM] nicnl
our current theory is that the game is "marking" them in some way
- the longer serial still gives an identical weapon in-game
- it's not player dependant, someone else did the buyback and got the same code
- it's not location dependant, I've tried different vending machine types and different location
- the changing serial only happens once: additional sell/buybacks stays on the same longer serial


[10/3/2025 10:57 AM] nicnl
now I wonder:


[10/3/2025 10:57 AM] nicnl
are the weapons found in chest "marked" in the same way as when bought from a vending machine?


[10/3/2025 11:01 AM] nicnl
^ I guess this is simple to check: I get a weapon from a chest, sell it, buy it back, and compare if the serial either got longer or stayed the same length


[10/3/2025 11:02 AM] inflamedsebi
well, what if chests would make it longer and shops just add on top as well ...


[10/3/2025 11:04 AM] nicnl
:WorryEyes:


[10/3/2025 11:04 AM] nicnl
there's no way to know for sure if weapons from chests are "actually" tagged


[10/3/2025 11:05 AM] inflamedsebi
not unless we completely decode the data ...


[10/3/2025 11:05 AM] nicnl
if the shop adds onto it, well, you're right we're fucked


[10/3/2025 11:05 AM] awsam.
I'm sorry, can you explain what you're talking about?


[10/3/2025 11:05 AM] nicnl
when you sell your weapon to a shop and then buy it back


[10/3/2025 11:05 AM] nicnl
the serial changes, it gets longer


[10/3/2025 11:05 AM] nicnl
this is super interesting


[10/3/2025 11:06 AM] awsam.
I believe this might help you understand a bit more.

[10/3/2025 11:11 AM] d_
I dont think there are enough bits in the weapon code that can store the GUID, so the game is deriving a GUID from the bits, but why?


[10/3/2025 11:13 AM] inflamedsebi
could be for referencing a weapon during runtime.
On startup you assign every weapon a guid and now you can check if 2 weapons are the same or just coincidently identical ...

Universally unique identifier
A universally unique identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit number that is designed to be unique in the broadest sense and is generally used to identify objects in computer systems. The term globally unique identifier (GUID) is also used, mostly in Microsoft-designed systems.
When generated via a typical method, a UUID is almost surely unique across all...


[10/3/2025 11:13 AM] d_
but why would they need to do that


[10/3/2025 11:14 AM] nicnl
this is what I'm thinking as well:
- a guid is 32 hex-digits
- the smallest weapon I have (a white jakobs sniper) is 50 hex-digits
  - so we're left with 18 usable digits
- most weapons are starting with a 16 hex-digits header that (seems to) describe: item type/manufacturer/weapon type
  - so we're left with.... 2 hex-digits for all the data about the weapon?


[10/3/2025 11:15 AM] nicnl
it sounds unlikely


[10/3/2025 11:15 AM] nicnl
now if the guid also contains data about the weapon, that's something else

{Reactions}
worrythink

[10/3/2025 11:19 AM] inflamedsebi
we could bit compare a guid with the hex of the serial. maybe the guid does contain the header data, but what to put in the other 16bit?
this raises to much questions sadly.

What do you mean by cosmetic pieces? They have the same skin and visually they have the same model parts I don’t think besides skin that there are and purely cosmetic components to guns as each model part change corresponds with a stat change letting you visually see if you have the best gun parts.

[10/3/2025 5:14 PM] inflamedsebi
Well if we figure out the part size we could try to use that as a prefered token size


[10/3/2025 5:14 PM] nicnl
i guess


[10/3/2025 5:14 PM] nicnl
i'll try to come up with something


[10/3/2025 5:15 PM] inflamedsebi
My guess is still a part beinh around 10-12 bits


[10/3/2025 5:15 PM] nicnl
maybe an exponential score, like length^2 for each matched pattern


[10/3/2025 5:15 PM] nicnl
that way if it matches "01" everywhere it'll be worthless


[10/3/2025 5:15 PM] nicnl
ah and maybe the number of matches, like there must be the smallest number possible (1 preferably)


[10/3/2025 5:19 PM] inflamedsebi
Since you try to automate it anyway, it can be slow, right?

So what if you match it multiple times and start with the smallest token size and the just do it again and increase token size until matching gets worse again?


[10/3/2025 5:19 PM] nicnl
you'd be surprised


[10/3/2025 5:20 PM] inflamedsebi
So start matching with 2 bit token first, which would be easy but not really helpful, next round token size of 4 bit, then 6, 8, 10, up to 2 byte maybe


[10/3/2025 5:20 PM] nicnl
1) taking this string as an example `abcdef`
2) cutting it into every pieces possible : `a b c d e f ab bc cd de ef abc bcd def abcd cdef abcdef`
3) try to find it in both weapon, retain only the common ones

this one is easy

there have the same length as so long 2 serial has the same length you can merge stuff easily for relics and class mods

Aight


[10/3/2025 5:26 PM] inflamedsebi
I‘d go for abcdef and split ab cd ef and try to find those in the new string. If successfull next try would be abc def.
And so on until matching gets worse….


[10/3/2025 5:26 PM] nicnl
well it's basically the same except I allow for arbitrary long patterns

A bitstream with arbitrary token sizes are absolutely garbage to work with… i dont thing they are completely random, maybe 2 different token sizes, long one for header and shorter one for parts or something. In theory shorter tokens would also match the longer ones as long as they are a multiple in length. Thats why i would like to try fixed token sizes.
If matches work best on 4bit and 6bit this would indicate fields are either 8 bit or 12 bit.

From the serialization dump we can see, they work with 8bit bitmasks and also various sized other data


[10/3/2025 5:38 PM] inflamedsebi
And apparently some parts of the serial can be reordered, so each moveable part either is prefixed with a size indicator, or all parts are the same token size. Else decoding would not be possible

Selling adds about  20bit of data and somehow reorganizes parts of the serial, to optically change it a lot, while on bit level is mostly the same, just a little reorganized …

it only looks different at a hex level

Tail is special since it has padding, so one cannot say where the data actually ends

[10/3/2025 9:42 PM] nicnl
is this really the 1:1 data of the serial? or is this the dump of the UObject in memory


[10/3/2025 9:46 PM] adozon
i guess time stamp is contained in <b6;o . this part basically do nothing .


[10/3/2025 9:48 PM] nicnl
i think it changes the price

this 2 items have same part of those but selling value is different dramaticaly . maybe its affected by a repeated parts strings .
so possibility "timestamp" affect selling value ?


[10/3/2025 9:59 PM] nicnl
the weapon price is directly affected by the parts list
broken weapons with missing parts costs a lot less


[10/3/2025 9:59 PM] darealslimballin
Not sure ase Vendors also have a serization method being applyed in SDK view


[10/3/2025 9:59 PM] nicnl
and broken weapons with duplicate parts cost more...

This is an awesome tool.
May I add a feature request?

We already know comparing on @U-serial level doesn't make much sense.
looking at comparing hex-serial it looks way more structured, but I m not yet convinced the serial struct is based on 4 (8,12,16,...) bit especially when it differs so much from binary comparison.
Can we convert the the serial to a base4/2bit representation (like DNA) and compare those?
00 = a; 01 = c; 10 = g; 11 = t
This might allow us to see 6/10/14/18 bit sequences and isn't as long as binary 🙂

I did this my hands a few times, but it is a bit tendious...


[10/4/2025 10:03 AM] nicnl
Yes


[10/4/2025 10:08 AM] nicnl
I will also integrate the bitswap feature


[10/4/2025 10:27 AM] nicnl

[10/4/2025 11:20 AM] orinx
going to try it with thouse simular sheilds


[10/4/2025 11:52 AM] orinx
well managed to change one of the buffs on sheilds without breaking anything 8 times


[10/4/2025 11:55 AM] orinx
and the game didn't "fix" any of the codes either


[10/4/2025 12:00 PM] orinx
it was changing the bits in the 6-4 from right spot


[10/4/2025 12:12 PM] orinx
I wonder if I can make a map of shield buff to a 4 bit number so I can identify the part in other strings


[10/4/2025 12:13 PM] orinx
then editing a part would just be using a libary of part numbers to identify them in a donar code and swaping them out till you have what you want.


[10/4/2025 12:14 PM] orinx
so even without fully understanding all the parts of a code you can still change enough to get what you want


[10/4/2025 12:28 PM] orinx
ok clearly I am not just changing the shield addon

[10/4/2025 12:28 PM] nicnl
the damage did change


[10/4/2025 12:29 PM] nicnl
either:
- there are multiple spike "tiers"
- or the spike addon requires an additional data block governing its stats


[10/4/2025 12:30 PM] orinx
they also are visualy different


[10/4/2025 12:30 PM] nicnl
ah, then it's just a swapped part
weapons work the same


[10/4/2025 12:30 PM] nicnl
on snipers, different grips affect reload time and accuracy for instance


[10/4/2025 12:31 PM] orinx
ya some how a part code is overlapping in that section I started modifying


[10/4/2025 12:32 PM] orinx
the wierd thing is I just changed the 3rd to last bit to get 8 new parts and about half of them have new traits and the otehr have the same traits


[10/4/2025 12:32 PM] inflamedsebi
The thing about padding is, you dont know where it starts.
fe
A value of  168 is a8 in hex and 10101000 in binary.
Since data is saved as a bitstream data spans across bytes. So those tailing zeros of 168 might reach into a new byte. To save this bitstream you would fill it with 0 until the last byte is full. 
Thus making it seems like there is too much padding without use, but in reality some of those 0 are part of the data.


[10/4/2025 12:34 PM] orinx
I should go into bl3 to remind me of what parts sheilds have as it seams like with gund they have the same type of stat parts


[10/4/2025 12:35 PM] inflamedsebi
And of course if the last field of data is bigger than 255 (1byte) this can lead to more than 1 byte of 0 at the end 🙂


[10/4/2025 12:36 PM] orinx
I was also messing with a bit that was all the same in the 5 sample codes I had started looking at


[10/4/2025 12:37 PM] adozon
how genius,  i saw ton of 0x54 on other code and that binary is  01010100 . i see it looks kinda marker or something .


[10/4/2025 12:37 PM] orinx
it was beside the 3 bits that where different and seamed to be related to shield traits but there are more than 8 traits


[10/4/2025 12:43 PM] orinx
and then messing with 4 bits in a row in the middle of the code did  1) add a second double roll trait, b) changed the element 3) add a trait without changing anything else

I tried swapping parts from a buyback weapon onto a normal one


[10/4/2025 1:33 PM] nicnl
There were two (or three) results:
- The weapon spawned, kept its name/level/rarity, but parts were broken
- Corruption 1:  it "spawned", but as "prowling"  (the game parsed the data incorrectly)
- Corruption 2:  it did not spawn


[10/4/2025 1:33 PM] nicnl
The last two kind of corruption are suggesting the targeted bits are directly related to serial length, and/or the bitshift effect we've been observing

I'm gonna implement more stuff into the serial comparator tool :
- base 4
- togglable base
- multi-comparison if possible
- automatic bitswap to yaml inventory format
- paste multiple serials at once
- check serials by clicking anywhere on the tile

[10/4/2025 2:51 PM] inflamedsebi
Well the thing with bitpacking is, there might not be markers in the stream itself, just a long stream of data.
To turn it back into multiple data fields you can either use marker or just use a static field size. Since bitpacking is used for high density data packing, using markers would kinda defeat the whole purpose of bitpacking, so it usually is based on predefined structure instead.
fe
usually if you want to store numbers from 0 to 31 (lets take 7,13,25,3) each takes up 1 byte and you end up with a binary like :
00000111 00001101 00011001 00000011
there is a lot of unused bit, since each byte could store up to 8 bit but we only use 5 at maximum.
If I would apply bitpacking and just state that each field takes 5 bit it would shrink to:
00111011 01110010 0011
the last byte is obviously not full with data, but we can't store partial bytes, so we fill with 0
it now becomes:
00111011 01110010 00110000
And as you can see is this small example we saved 25% and even had to fill with 0 which could have been more data.
The tricky part now is to unpack this mess into its original size.
If I would tell you each number is 5 bit, you could easily unpack it, determine the padding, etc, but if I don't tell you anything, this explicit binary could be
10-12 values at 2 bit; 7-8 values at 3 bit; 5-6 values at 4 bit; 4 values at 5-6 bit; 3 values at 7-8 bit; 2 values at 10-12 bit; 1 value at 20 bit;
Too many options to just try it. And lets not talk about bitstreams with different sized fields at all ...
But the more guns we modify and analyze we might be able to find structure.


[10/4/2025 2:54 PM] nicnl
I mean, code cannot decode ambiguous data.
Intuitively, the size of the "next block" is governed by its type, so there HAS to be some kind of "marker" somewhere, no?


[10/4/2025 2:55 PM] nicnl
When I say marker, it's more like decoding steps
>  "this is a weapon.... this is a jackobs sniper.... this is an uncommon.... this has 4 parts...."
with each step changing how many bits to read


[10/4/2025 2:57 PM] inflamedsebi
Well not neccesarily if I tell you there is a 5 byte header (1 Manufactuerer, 1 weapontype, etc) and the rest is 6bit, you could decode any stream with this even without any marker inside the stream.
But yeah if weapons of different type would use different sctructures it would be marker and data in one.... but hell I hope not :pepeW: 
The would be crazy to figure out.


[10/4/2025 2:58 PM] inflamedsebi
In theory each gun part could have a uniqe attatched payload size specific for this part ...

I still don't know where sparkie  found the base85 serializing function
It has unnamed variables typical of a decompiler (ghidra?)
And I haven't found binaries or anything interesting in a SDK zip that was posted a while ago


[10/4/2025 3:12 PM] inflamedsebi
It would help if LLM peeps would feed it with the bitstream data instead of the base85 encoded string.
The used base85 encoding is somewhat special and mostly obfuscates data structure. I highly doubt an LLV would be able to figure this out.
But feeding hex or binary instead could yield helpful results, since pattern recognition should be a strength of AI.

I'm still not fully convinced this base 85 decoding is correct, since it differs from the "usual" ones. But this specific implementation seems optimized for bitstreams, which makes sense. If this was a wrong decoding implementation it could produce something like this:

Identical data sets with just some additions could show scrambled data in a 4 byte pattern (since base 85 is based on 4 byte data) 
Interestingly we have idetical datasets with just some additions (probably) and the data seems scrambled in a 4 byte pattern ...

this doesnt add skills or remove, its meant to rotate them in different skills 1 by 1


[10/4/2025 3:37 PM] .zatoh
i want to know does overflowing the skills stack or just visual


[10/4/2025 3:37 PM] whiteshark2020
so if you want a 5-skill mod you need a 5-skill mod


[10/4/2025 3:37 PM] whiteshark2020
according to @Mattmab it works


[10/4/2025 3:38 PM] whiteshark2020
so you get 8 you see 5 , but its 8


[10/4/2025 3:38 PM] .zatoh
oh ok


[10/4/2025 3:39 PM] whiteshark2020

sadly i still don't fully understand this specific base85 decoding implementation since base85 in general is too weird for me 🙁
Changing 1 bit will scramble the the whole serial, this just feels weird. but this is probably a side effect on using little endian ... which does feels weird to use in a bitstream when you hex and binary use big endian style ...

the more than 5 was a report from another user. im not sure anything past 5 truly works. the secondary perks are stacked like damage and gun damage so that may be where the report was truly coming from and not over on perks.

well if your structure is exactly 4bytes changing a single bit should not change the whole serial ... this is not really a problem if you dont work with the serials manually, but it just feels strange in contrast to hex and binary.

this does look somewaht better but periodic scrambles for the same weapon doesn't make sense at all ... if the order was changed, sure the might be indexed, but the are not reordered, so it should not change ...

rebuying a gun should not add much data in different parts ... so yes this makes much more sense there.
but looking at the pattern a gun with 6 parts each with around 4 bytes sounds a little better than 16 parts with around 1 byte...
but yeah thats all speculation ...

We should focus on finding the part size, so this finally makes more sense xD


[10/4/2025 4:00 PM] inflamedsebi
I did not look at class mods yet. We specifically just looked at jacobs snipers with the same scope, just to have something consistend.
Classmods might have a completely different structure and just share the base85 encoding, but they could use more or less data per part.

[10/4/2025 5:30 PM] inflamedsebi
@Sparkie Sorry for the ping, but can you share, where you got the base 85 decoding algorithm from?
For context:
We are comparing identical weapons with different serials (buying back from a vending machine adds flags to the header thus bitshifting the stream and changing the serial)
but somehow the items only partially match up. So we are wondering if the decoding might be big endian instead of little or if there might be other issues with the algorithm.


[10/4/2025 5:31 PM] inflamedsebi
Lets see if he answers ^^"


[10/4/2025 5:39 PM] inflamedsebi
sadly I m no help with fixing the encode 🙁


[10/4/2025 5:39 PM] nicnl
i reverted everything


[10/4/2025 5:40 PM] nicnl
because I fear it's discarding bits, hence producing the better match


[10/4/2025 5:51 PM] inflamedsebi
if i use the hex decoded via python and big endian it gets worse with matching 🙁

we cannot do that yet. All we can do is paste those 2 serials to AI and force it to give permutations and it is pure luck if you get a broken one, something completely different, or something you are looking for.

While preparing the rifle scopes I just wanted to figure out level marker, which should be easy, right? Surprise, it is not!

Beginning sequences of:
Level 50 sniper                              VVVVVV = 50 ok

                                                  VVV VVV (notice level sequence is between bytes)

Level 48 sniper - bitswapped                 VVVVVV = 48 ok
100000000110000011100000100001000010001000001110000001100000

Level 34 sniper - bitswapped                 VVVVVV = 18 ?!?
100000000110000011100000100001000010001000001010010001100000

Level 18 sniper - bitswapped                !VVVVVV = 50 ?!?
100000000110000011100000100001000010001000000110010001100000```

So maybe level is a signed int and somehow calculated. but this would mean
111001 as a signed value would be -7 and somehow represent level 50
111000 as a signed value would be -8 and somehow represent level 48
which does not make sense, if the former is 50, the latter had to be 49 for this to work.

So again we are having issues crossing byte borders. I'm even more convinced our base 85 decoding sucks ...
Retrying it with big endian split the whole level marker apart, so little endian seems to be correct, but bits are still scrambled on local byte borders...

level 50 marker                                  11 0 010
```
This can consistently change the weapon level, BUT reducing it to lower levels did change other parts of the string as well, which probably means some parts/stats cannot occur on lower levels and get altered on load. So there might be error correction going on!


[10/5/2025 9:02 AM] anro_19
the only consistence i found on weapons are that the licensed parts are always on the end


[10/5/2025 9:06 AM] inflamedsebi
since there is a gap inside the level marker this absolutely makes no sense. our decoding must be off....

so since yesterday I've forced the webtool on 1032


[10/5/2025 9:11 AM] inflamedsebi
as far as I can tell, the endianess is correct "little",
but inside each byte there is a scramble.

didn't we notice this with the scopes as well?
the could be reproduced quite good untill the ended up at a byte border and suddenly could not match up anymore ....


[10/5/2025 9:11 AM] inflamedsebi
oh so i was already using your optimized byte order?

hmm yeah i'm making it configurable


[10/5/2025 9:16 AM] inflamedsebi
03 is probably correct, else the level marker would split apart. but there is still issues inside a single byte ..


[10/5/2025 9:17 AM] inflamedsebi
if we can fix the issues inside the byte we might need to adjust the byte order again ...

I assuming decoder and encoder needs to be appropriate tail .

serial length not 5*n+2 is needs to fill 0 right side till 5*n+2 and its LE

after padded , FF appear on last 4 bytes in many case.

perfect length for b85 5*n+2 is also LE but it may use BE on last 5 letters i think .
so much 00 in head of 4byte is looks strange 

```
len 51 = 49 + 2 needs 1 padding 0

im not sure about it , so i encode with each length of same item with it .

what byte order are you using?

if game skip FF make tail like a perfect length is works well? im using LE


[10/5/2025 9:46 AM] inflamedsebi
encoding is issue number 2 ...
but for now we cant even decode properly, so every encoding of previously decoded hex is automatically wrong too. 😂 
but as long as you not alter the length of the decoded hex, it will encode correctly, but your decoded data might be scrambled...


[10/5/2025 9:47 AM] nicnl
i'm seeing your ff indeed

yeah you're right
luckily, as long at the encoding/decoding passes a roundtrip, we can bitswap safely


[10/5/2025 9:47 AM] adozon
yea this is obviously strange and 5*n(without @u) is perfect length for B85 . its smelling


[10/5/2025 9:49 AM] inflamedsebi
I cant really follow. so the tail might be big endian, since the ff might be padding, but it is in the wrong place?


[10/5/2025 9:51 AM] adozon
thats right if the FF placed head of 4 bytes it looks says this is tail. but FF is nt placed at there and that moves around when it is different length of serials

byte order is good to see . 4*3*2*1 = 24 pattern


[10/5/2025 9:55 AM] inflamedsebi
ok I get it now, but wouldn't it possible they padded the body so when adding the tail it gets to 5n?
and can we confirm all legit extracted serials are2+5n?


[10/5/2025 9:55 AM] superexboom
currently, everyone's work is based on base85. could this ever be invalidated?  just a guess


[10/5/2025 9:55 AM] superexboom
Suppose the item generation mechanism is fully deciphered.😁


[10/5/2025 10:01 AM] adozon
to adds pads to body , decorder has to know where is body ? it looks hard to do it . am i understand what you say im sorry .


[10/5/2025 10:02 AM] nicnl
done, can paste a list of serials now (delimited by line breaks)


[10/5/2025 10:04 AM] inflamedsebi
it is base85, that is confirmed. but base85 is not really standardized there are a lot of different ways to do it.
let alone which byte order to use and offsets, etc

fe base 85 uses 5 characters to encode 4 bytes. 4 bytes are 2^32 (=4.294.967.296) and 5 char are 85^5 (=4.437.053.125)
so base85 can actually encode more than 4 bytes so to put 4 bytes into 5 chars you have room for interpretation ...


[10/5/2025 10:06 AM] superexboom
Compared to BL3, it looks incredibly much more complex...


[10/5/2025 10:06 AM] nicnl
some details about it can be invalidated (for instance: byte order, padding, and alphabet)
but we have too many proofs about base85 working reasonably well to be canceled

the biggest example is the buybacks
i don't know if you followed this, but
we noticed that selling and buying back a weapon from a vending machine changes the serial: it gets longer, and seems to totally change
(only works on weapons NOT obtained through vending machines, eg: looted)
heres is an example
```
BEFORE: @Ugy3L+2}TYg%$yC%i7M2gZldO)@}cgb!l34$a-qf{00
AFTER:  @Ugy3L+2}Ta0Od!I{*`S=LLLKTRY91;d>K-Z#Y7QzFY8(O
```
as you will notice, those serials are completely different

however, look at what happens when we 
1. remove the leading "@U"
2. decode from base85 using 1032 byte order

sudenly the resulting hexadecimal strings are very comparable

[10/5/2025 10:06 AM] inflamedsebi
oh yes decoding could be an issue if padding is between body and tail, but not neccesarily ... if tail is always less then 4 bytes or you know the size of the body in advance, this would be easy ...


[10/5/2025 10:12 AM] superexboom
I've been keep noticed for a few days and have indeed noticed this. since it appears overly unstable, so all of the above is purely “personal speculation.”


[10/5/2025 10:13 AM] nicnl
i mean, known identical weapons


[10/5/2025 10:13 AM] nicnl
that goes from wildly different serials to 80% aligning hex strings


[10/5/2025 10:13 AM] nicnl
statistically, it's not speculation


[10/5/2025 10:15 AM] nicnl
it's absolutely impossible for 40+ bytes to magically align out of the air, especially when it's coming from base transformations of two wildly different strings


[10/5/2025 10:17 AM] superexboom

[10/5/2025 10:18 AM] nicnl
we are able to somewhat alter items by bitswapping


[10/5/2025 10:18 AM] nicnl
basically we take an existing item


[10/5/2025 10:18 AM] nicnl
and we try to flip each bit


[10/5/2025 10:19 AM] nicnl
expectedly, the effects are wildly varying: the level changes, some parts changes, or some parts disappear, or the weapon is corrupted and doesn't spawn


[10/5/2025 10:19 AM] nicnl
we've been able to semi-reliably swap the elemental damage of weapons for instance (fire/shock/corrosive)

This is a natural looted gun but does not fit 2+5n
So serials do not need to be 2+5n at all.

If the compared serials don't have gaps ( no `+`     only `!`)
There's a button for generating all combinations to YAML format

but does on 3210

So I was modding classmods and had this happen. If figured out, could be a way to have all firmware sets active at once.

yes because the decoding is wrong!
I wrote my own base85 decoder and the results are still bad, but more consistent!

[10/5/2025 12:44 PM] inflamedsebi
this is what my decoder did...
the is still an increased bit in the header, which could mean the header determines the length! and selling to a vender adds data, so increasing length by 1!


[10/5/2025 12:46 PM] inflamedsebi
all misaligned bits are in the beginning of a byte. so maybe my decoder is wrong as well but to be honest im happy it kinda works ... still not 100% sure how base85 works....


[10/5/2025 12:47 PM] inflamedsebi
oh and it is python , but not worth porting to js as long as it is still faulty


[10/5/2025 12:49 PM] nicnl
the most important part I think is to write its encoder


[10/5/2025 12:49 PM] nicnl
so you can do a round trip (decode, encode, decode, check if it's the same) and be sure no data is being lost


[10/5/2025 12:50 PM] nicnl
because base85 is tricky, if your decoding function is discarding some bits.... then yes, the outputs are gonna look more similar than before


[10/5/2025 12:50 PM] nicnl
:PES_BlushGiggle:


[10/5/2025 12:52 PM] inflamedsebi
adjusted the spacing in my example!
Since data got added to the header we get shifting, but not full byte shifting!
and whenever data is in the same byte than from before the shift, it stays, but if it was shifted across byte borders, it did change!!

yes we know, but this is a decoder issue. we decode the exact same item with different serials. the part order is the same, but we can still see shifts in the data, which means our base85 decoder is not the same as the borderlands one

you're right


[10/5/2025 1:52 PM] inflamedsebi
because there is a pattern in the shifts. usually the serial never changes, but if you sell a gun, data is added to mark it as sold/bought, which changes the servial.
However the gun still has the same parts. now if we look at bitwise data, we should be able to reoder the weapon parts to make the unsold one, but wecant sind there is somethin odd going on ...


[10/5/2025 1:52 PM] nicnl

I dont think you can. I think the engine rerolls the parts order every time. Per unique serial.


[10/5/2025 1:54 PM] mattmab
But part placement doesn't really matter then.


[10/5/2025 1:54 PM] mattmab
Hence why we get so many identical items with unique serials.


[10/5/2025 1:55 PM] inflamedsebi
remember that gun we bought pack and the scope was suddenly in 2 places? thats why!

When we are stacking parts it doesn't seem like part order matters.

fa0c is the matching then.


[10/5/2025 1:56 PM] inflamedsebi
part order doesnt matter but each part hast to be in one piece, but right now the decoder sometimes splits parts to different locations in teh data, wich is clearly a decoder issue


[10/5/2025 1:56 PM] mattmab
Just happened to have another part that was similar


[10/5/2025 1:57 PM] mattmab
If thr serial is unique it's not a decoder issue. Parts are ordered differently


[10/5/2025 1:58 PM] inflamedsebi
the 08 and 2204 might be the added data after buying. the also get split up!


[10/5/2025 1:58 PM] shirtnoservice
Doesn't that mean the unknown part is simply the identifier for being bought?

Is it the same for each weapon and if it is, could you not just program it to remove that bit if it's causing issues?


[10/5/2025 2:00 PM] inflamedsebi
we cant just erase data, without knowing what we erase ...

We are looking at this for severals days now, 
our decoder has an issue where it doesn't output the data in correct order.
since we dont know what we are looking at, we simply didnt notice at first.

first odd things were, that we could consistently change scopes to a specific other ones, then we noticed sold weapons change their serial, so we tried change scopes on that weapon., but the bits to chnage the scope suddenly werent in one place (the scope part) but in 2 places far apart.

and now we found out why!


[10/5/2025 2:05 PM] nicnl
look at that

we're left with this


[10/5/2025 2:06 PM] nicnl
- a bit flipped at the end
- 5 additional hex digits in the middle
- an additional hex digit at the end


[10/5/2025 2:06 PM] inflamedsebi
that has to be it ... sparkies decoder is amost correct, there is just some weird misalignment, which makes parts of the data go round ...


[10/5/2025 2:07 PM] nicnl
why would the data go round though?


[10/5/2025 2:07 PM] nicnl
it's not


[10/5/2025 2:07 PM] inflamedsebi
the the wrong part obviously xD


[10/5/2025 2:07 PM] nicnl
all the encoders pass a round trip, and the start of the string doesn't affect the end


[10/5/2025 2:07 PM] nicnl
and, as far as we know


[10/5/2025 2:08 PM] nicnl
the buyback weapon still looks like wildly different


[10/5/2025 2:08 PM] nicnl
so I think this has more to do with how the game serializes its data than the base85 decoder itself


[10/5/2025 2:11 PM] inflamedsebi
oh wait ....
what if the data is not a single base85 string, but 2 just added together?
decoding them as 1 would move data around, where it shouldnt be!


[10/5/2025 2:12 PM] inflamedsebi
what is the header of the gun is a single base85 string and the parts are on its own?

the topmost left bit gets discarded

what still borders me is, that now every bit sequence is in reverse order .... like the level marker and probably all the part ids and stats as well ....

uh

[10/5/2025 4:45 PM] inflamedsebi
but that would put all the metadata at the end ... which is weird too ....


[10/5/2025 4:45 PM] nicnl
yeah I agree


[10/5/2025 4:45 PM] nicnl
the item type/manufacturer is always at the start


[10/5/2025 4:45 PM] orinx
maybe each section is reversed


[10/5/2025 4:45 PM] autorune
what if its intended to be sent out in reverse order


[10/5/2025 4:46 PM] nicnl
how would they even write a serialization routine that writes from end to start wtf


[10/5/2025 4:46 PM] nicnl
is that even possible?

maybe reversing makes it easier to pack for network transit?


[10/5/2025 4:47 PM] orinx
well that probably is one thing they where hopeing for


[10/5/2025 4:48 PM] autorune
this is all centered around optimising sending shit tons of these things across potentally dogshit network connections so


[10/5/2025 4:48 PM] orinx

where are we at here also? Can someone catch me up


[10/5/2025 5:25 PM] inflamedsebi
as far as i can tell, the balance is not part of the gun, but calculated by a sum of the parts/level, etc


[10/5/2025 5:27 PM] nicnl
are you aware of the buyback thing?


[10/5/2025 5:28 PM] autorune
how did you obtain the original serial for it @Nicnl


[10/5/2025 5:29 PM] nicnl
serial for what


[10/5/2025 5:29 PM] autorune
buyback


[10/5/2025 5:29 PM] inflamedsebi
btw since bits are reversed and we still have floating bits inside markers, i dont need base 4 anymore.
but i would add afeature request for the bitswapping thing.
So i can set a range for bitswapping.
I dont need 300 broken guns when just want to fiddle with rarity or manufacturer...
So setting a range in bits to swap would help a lot ^^


[10/5/2025 5:30 PM] inflamedsebi
we did not. We took a looted gun and sold it, so we already had the original serial before selling it.


[10/5/2025 5:35 PM] autorune
Ah right OK


[10/5/2025 5:35 PM] autorune

the github page about borderlands 3 says this:
> The next four bytes are an unsigned 32-bit integer which is the random "seed" used to encrypt/obfuscate the rest of the serial number.
> This is a scheme that's been present in Borderlands savegames since at least BL2. (And possibly earlier?)
> The encryption is quite basic and is really more like obfuscation than actual encryption.

same, else the level marker would work so flawlessly

nah


[10/5/2025 6:04 PM] mattmab
so the vending machine is tagging them for the encryption algorithm


[10/5/2025 6:04 PM] nicnl
the weapon levels are a direct binary counter 0   1    10     11     100     101   etc...


[10/5/2025 6:04 PM] nicnl
it wouldn't happen if it was encrypted

question


[10/5/2025 6:05 PM] autorune
is the value the same for every buyback?


[10/5/2025 6:06 PM] mattmab
its probably a unique encryption value


[10/5/2025 6:06 PM] nicnl

[10/5/2025 6:16 PM] anro_19
I dont know if this information is usefull. I did today a lot of weapon edit and noticed something may be worth to mention. You can copy  from a other weapons parts without any issues as so long its the same class (Maliwan, Deadalus stuff like). Adding things like Jakobs or other also require change in the first part of the serial


[10/5/2025 6:16 PM] anro_19
Since im a idiot and tired. Yes it also works on serial codes with different serial length

alas, I think we have exhausted all the clues that the buyback could give us
the big mystery was:
okay the serials do change... but weren't we able to match both the original and the buyback?
it meant out decodng was wrong


[10/5/2025 6:56 PM] nicnl
after trial and error, we fixed out base85-to-hex, and now the original weapon is similar to the buyback

how do you automatically detect for buyback in a serial

But well I think the "changing" serial when buying back has been 80% solved

- we fixed our base85 decoder/encoder, and we're able to detect that the items after a buyback is the same as before

- however the data being added, we don't know what it does

buyback modification only happens once on an item? or repeatable?


[10/5/2025 7:03 PM] nicnl
only once


[10/5/2025 7:03 PM] nicnl
There has been two added sections :
- `0` at the end
  - most likely some padding, nothing substancial
- `0x32045` in the middle


[10/5/2025 7:04 PM] mattmab

```@Ugr$WBm/)}}$^;?/_6K^@pw>roLwd*-xg<BFhis8cazn02CAlOwq=#&gOL9Y^$R4o-00```

again these are identical so machines have no change on what it adds


[10/5/2025 7:04 PM] alienfreek
have you tried taking something like that and changine the 32045 to 32046? odd its followed by another 3204n


[10/5/2025 7:04 PM] mattmab
id have to guess that the value added is a sum of parts in some fashion. im still on the thought that its leftover code from the old game.


[10/5/2025 7:05 PM] nicnl
this `32045` in the middle is interesting because.... no other bits have been changed after the buyback
usually when looking at arbitrary-structured data, there HAS to be some kind of header, of identifier for a block section to appear


[10/5/2025 7:05 PM] nicnl
does that mean `32045` IS a block?


[10/5/2025 7:05 PM] nicnl
does that mean we have to look at 5-hex-digits blocks?


[10/5/2025 7:06 PM] alienfreek
it looks like it or something close, i cant see why the 3204n would repeat incremented otherwise


[10/5/2025 7:06 PM] alienfreek
im guessing you tried pulling the serial while it was still in machine too? does it only change *after* the buyback?


[10/5/2025 7:07 PM] mattmab
would the variable bit length have anything to do with that Nicnl?


[10/5/2025 7:07 PM] mattmab
let me load CE


[10/5/2025 7:08 PM] alienfreek
possibly the 0 added to the end is identifying that theres 2 expected 3204n blocks in the string


[10/5/2025 7:10 PM] mattmab
the hover edit dump cheat table i downloaded wont pull serial from in vending machine


[10/5/2025 7:10 PM] mattmab
in the buyback anyway


[10/5/2025 7:10 PM] mattmab
it will in buy and sell


[10/5/2025 7:10 PM] alienfreek
hmm


[10/5/2025 7:11 PM] alienfreek
maybe some hacky method to keep things in the buyback machine for your current session exclusively and thats what that data is for


[10/5/2025 7:11 PM] alienfreek
random guesses


[10/5/2025 7:12 PM] mattmab
serials keep after relaunching the game after selling and buyingback.


[10/5/2025 7:12 PM] mattmab
it is like permanatly flagging the gun as bought back.


[10/5/2025 7:12 PM] mattmab
does it do that when you buy direct from vendor?

[10/5/2025 7:13 PM] autorune
that value could be a reference to whatever mem location


[10/5/2025 7:13 PM] autorune
as you said


[10/5/2025 7:13 PM] alienfreek
itd be weird for it to keep after reload if so then


[10/5/2025 7:14 PM] alienfreek
is the amount of data added the same for each item do you know?


[10/5/2025 7:15 PM] thatdonfc
We need a CT that reads the items in the vending machines. I don't think any of the CT's in here have that yet


[10/5/2025 7:16 PM] autorune
not really a sought after feature lmao


[10/5/2025 7:16 PM] mattmab
oh yeah it doesnt read on buy


[10/5/2025 7:16 PM] mattmab
just on sell


[10/5/2025 7:16 PM] alienfreek
doesnt read? or doesnt change


[10/5/2025 7:16 PM] autorune
crash resilience, probably on some sort of timer


[10/5/2025 7:17 PM] mattmab
doesnt change like keeps showing last looked at serial. the other parts change


[10/5/2025 7:17 PM] mattmab
just the serial doesnt


[10/5/2025 7:17 PM] thatdonfc
I thought it would be a good way to grab a bunch of serials for legendaries by visiting Maurice, copying the serials from the items and then reloading to do it again. Much faster than farming a boss


[10/5/2025 7:17 PM] mattmab
whelp here i go learning how to attach to pointer addresses


[10/5/2025 7:19 PM] alienfreek
it looks like nhas reads from buyback page


[10/5/2025 7:19 PM] nicnl
you can do that with the one-shot $1 legendary quest


[10/5/2025 7:20 PM] mattmab
can you link me to it

lmao


[10/5/2025 7:21 PM] alienfreek
yeah for me its reading buyback items to item string (fake)


[10/5/2025 7:22 PM] mattmab
thanks


[10/5/2025 7:22 PM] mattmab
pretty sure thats what i already had


[10/5/2025 7:22 PM] alienfreek
its on rebuy, not on sell


[10/5/2025 7:22 PM] mattmab
buy doesnt work either


[10/5/2025 7:22 PM] alienfreek
so until bought back the code stays the same


[10/5/2025 7:23 PM] alienfreek
it does for me


[10/5/2025 7:23 PM] alienfreek

im on 7.2


[10/5/2025 7:30 PM] mattmab
tried downgrade to 7.2 still cant see in buy menu they dont update


[10/5/2025 7:30 PM] mattmab
🤷‍♂️


[10/5/2025 7:33 PM] mattmab
everything but serial works now


[10/5/2025 7:34 PM] alienfreek
that's really odd


[10/5/2025 7:34 PM] alienfreek
you restarted your game between reloading the ce/ct?


[10/5/2025 7:34 PM] alienfreek
I highly doubt it's why but I also use Sunbeam. if anything that would only lower the chance but idk


[10/5/2025 7:34 PM] alienfreek
I doubt special k effects jt


[10/5/2025 7:34 PM] mattmab
ahh there is a part string Fake


[10/5/2025 7:34 PM] alienfreek
yee


[10/5/2025 7:34 PM] mattmab
looks like that one is updating

[10/5/2025 7:34 PM] alienfreek
yessir that one will update with modded/none expected codes too


[10/5/2025 7:35 PM] alienfreek
but yeah it seemed like from the few items I tested that it was only on buy back that they changed, which honestly just makes it more confusing 💀


[10/5/2025 7:38 PM] mattmab
@THATDONFC that table works for maurices machine


[10/5/2025 7:41 PM] alienfreek
yeah dude I can't think of a single reason they would need serialization to trigger on buy back it doesn't make sense


[10/5/2025 7:41 PM] alienfreek
it had to have been some hacky fix for some issues they found during dev or just leftover


[10/5/2025 7:42 PM] alienfreek
maybe valkyr idea of crash protection but why only implement that for buybacks and not item pickup/transfer


[10/5/2025 7:42 PM] alienfreek
super interesting info either way, foolproof way to make an identical item with a new serial


[10/5/2025 7:42 PM] autorune

[10/5/2025 7:43 PM] alienfreek
so the extra 0 was removed in this case? or am I reading this backwards


[10/5/2025 7:44 PM] autorune
its just extrapolating the padding


[10/5/2025 7:45 PM] autorune
because we end up with a different size for full b85

I'm sure this is posted elsewhere, and I apologize for taking up your time. But when I edit my save, I put in the new code, I'm editing the yaml, correct? Will that correlate to my sav file? Or do I need to convert it to sav?

absolutely
this is just guessing based on the bitswap.
parts might be smaller or have separators. but they should be identifiable now...

hmm


[10/5/2025 9:16 PM] nicnl
so uh


[10/5/2025 9:16 PM] nicnl
you bitswapped, uh?


[10/5/2025 9:16 PM] nicnl
hmmm


[10/5/2025 9:17 PM] inflamedsebi
the knife yes.


[10/5/2025 9:17 PM] nicnl
what if I generated all possible 12 bits for one of the skills


[10/5/2025 9:17 PM] nicnl
hehehehehehehe


[10/5/2025 9:17 PM] nicnl
time to do that


[10/5/2025 9:17 PM] inflamedsebi
deleted every item that looked suspicious only kept "legit" ones


[10/5/2025 9:17 PM] nicnl
oh


[10/5/2025 9:17 PM] inflamedsebi

[10/5/2025 9:17 PM] nicnl
you bitswapped or generated all possible combinations?


[10/5/2025 9:18 PM] inflamedsebi
bitswapped the original


[10/5/2025 9:18 PM] inflamedsebi
then looked for similarities recurrent skills etc


[10/5/2025 9:19 PM] inflamedsebi
some skills showed up on different slots on the item.


[10/5/2025 9:19 PM] inflamedsebi
thats how i determined start end ending of the skills

[10/5/2025 9:23 PM] nicnl

there's a missing skill, i'm not crazy?


[10/5/2025 9:23 PM] inflamedsebi
sometimes firmware removes more than 1 skill, so i m not sure if this is correct


[10/5/2025 9:25 PM] nicnl
they're all three skill


[10/5/2025 9:25 PM] nicnl
there's no 2 skill


[10/5/2025 9:26 PM] inflamedsebi

[10/5/2025 9:27 PM] inflamedsebi
yes this is a faulty one ... it should have 4 skills, but there is only 2?


[10/5/2025 9:27 PM] nicnl
apparently the game "collapses" (reserialize) some badly structured serials


[10/5/2025 9:27 PM] nicnl
hmm


[10/5/2025 9:27 PM] nicnl
i'll export the serials from the save, and compare it to what I injected


[10/5/2025 9:28 PM] nicnl
it will only list "valid" serials


[10/5/2025 9:28 PM] inflamedsebi
when i bitswapped, i deleted every firmware and only kept items with 4 skills ...


[10/5/2025 9:28 PM] inflamedsebi
this was the most sane scenario i could think of


[10/5/2025 9:29 PM] nicnl
is this screen the original item?


[10/5/2025 9:29 PM] nicnl
i want to do another thing


[10/5/2025 9:29 PM] inflamedsebi
kinda yes there were abunch that looked exactly the same, so this might be a mutation but it looked like the original

my guess is that this common "center" is mostly an indicator to the game's deserialization function

That bonus actually works for the weapon alone. first half gives more dmg.

bunch of single part weapons i found, might be interesting to look at


[10/6/2025 1:12 AM] alienfreek
they all function, there are some with legendary perks above that linked message as well


[10/6/2025 1:16 AM] alienfreek
im sure that list was enough but heres another, if i remember correctly this is a legendary level 1 smg

Oh this is true


[10/6/2025 3:17 AM] nicnl
I didn't thought about extracting the reserialized single-parts weapon from the save


[10/6/2025 3:18 AM] nicnl
It can be a good way to figure out the basics of the structure


[10/6/2025 3:18 AM] nicnl
I'll take a look at this when I'm home from work... in approximately 10 hours :sad_cat:

this looks same but so much different from those two.
barance is not same , if it contain broken parts .  is it affecting big difference? hmm

@Nicnl @Alien biggest one to get hold of is identical with different numbers of parts to get whatever determines parts array length


[10/6/2025 5:18 AM] autorune
It might well be around here. That's a huge number in hex and may well determine a huge stack of parts... No way is that a 4 byte int to determine array length


[10/6/2025 5:20 AM] nicnl
Oh this is a good observation


[10/6/2025 5:20 AM] nicnl
I love it how stuff is being figured out from random clues


[10/6/2025 5:21 AM] nicnl
For instance the whole buyback thing was a literally a keystone for the weird base85 encoding


[10/6/2025 5:21 AM] nicnl
And yet it happened by pure chance: I almost didn't investigate into it!


[10/6/2025 5:22 AM] nicnl
When it happened, I was skeptic that the serial actually changed
I thought I copied the wrong serial or whatever


[10/6/2025 6:29 AM] inflamedsebi
we figured the decoding out yesterday. You might want to use nicnls webtool to decode serials and check with your attemts.
there is wild shenanigans with reversing bits ... but it works now. Buyback weapons look perfect and also comparing other guns does.


[10/6/2025 6:34 AM] adozon
yea i say thankyou so much . and that FF was because of I had nt check enough to I could put tail function to my local decoder or not .


[10/6/2025 7:18 AM] akamoden
everything i made. i had a fun time. you won't see this on nexus or anything. just for you guys. hope it helps. i give up. all these tool function. main.py solves the encoding, has hybrid mode, strict mode, and true mode. if you know python have a peak. its CLI based. no fancy GUI. keep .json as they are. readme has quick start guide. if you see CLI commands and wonder what they are used for, i have a few other .pys i didn't include due to wanting to make it simple enough for everyone. unzip these. keep them all in the same folder. like i said i hope it helps. i give up lol.

We had quite a breakthrough yesterday


[10/6/2025 7:27 AM] akamoden
i saw and thats acutally what prompted me to share it. i felt kinda like a jerk since i had figured it out but wasn't sharing and just kept saying "trust me bro". if it does nothing other than give you an idea i'd be pretty happy. maybe mine is flawed aswel.. i get pretty bad tunnel vision when doing projects.

Weird, we don't have the same base85 alphabet


[10/6/2025 7:34 AM] nicnl
Did you follow the whole buyback thing?


[10/6/2025 7:34 AM] akamoden
yeah the buyback items are tail only items. and get rehydrated when you buy them -> reserialized into your inventory


[10/6/2025 7:34 AM] akamoden
reserialized*


[10/6/2025 7:35 AM] nicnl
Did you manage to match and align the original item with its buyback?


[10/6/2025 7:35 AM] nicnl
That was our BIG problem until we figured out the altered base85 BL4 is using


[10/6/2025 7:36 AM] nicnl
- BL4 uses a custom base85 alphabet
- Décodes in big endian
- And then REVERSES THE BIT ORDER of each individual bytes (this is fucking UNHOLY)


[10/6/2025 7:36 AM] nicnl
Without this, we were unable to match the original item with its buyback
There were many bit differences everywhere


[10/6/2025 7:37 AM] akamoden
ah


[10/6/2025 7:37 AM] akamoden
i havent tried. honestly i put this project down when people started to just mash items together. and i figured. since it works.

We don't know, but the results we're getting now are REALLY good


[10/6/2025 7:41 AM] nicnl
This is the comparison between an item and it's reserialized buyback version WITHOUT bit reversing

[10/6/2025 7:48 AM] nicnl
In the web tool, there is a "load dataset" button
There are pack of identical items but from level 1 to 50
You can then select them all and click "compare 50 serials"
At the bottom of the page you will be able to see where the level bits are located


[10/6/2025 7:48 AM] akamoden
i see, ill update my main.py for this.


[10/6/2025 7:49 AM] nicnl
By combining this with bitswapping, we are able to reliably mutate any item to any level


[10/6/2025 7:49 AM] nicnl
HOWEVER


[10/6/2025 7:49 AM] nicnl
It's still a per-item basis!


[10/6/2025 7:51 AM] nicnl
The exact position of the level bits are moving depending of the item


[10/6/2025 7:53 AM] nicnl
A second issue is that the level bits seems to have a floating "1" in the middle


[10/6/2025 7:54 AM] nicnl
-> the level bits are incrementing as if this 1 was not here at all, which is weird as fuck


[10/6/2025 7:54 AM] nicnl
But eh


[10/6/2025 8:00 AM] autorune
that can't be a design thing surely though, potentially a padding or decode issue :think:


[10/6/2025 8:03 AM] akamoden
here is updated main.py to include the bit reversal. if its needed. i have my doubts. tbh. but its at the top. right under my BL4 alphabet. i also re arranged some defs cause they were out of place.

Now that we are reversing the bits, the MSB is at the right...

[10/6/2025 8:16 AM] akamoden
let me explain. but maybe im wrong.


[10/6/2025 8:17 AM] akamoden
BL4 serials aren’t one flat bitstring, they’re Base-85 blocks. Different title/parts change the mid bytes and the remainder, so the encoder re-tiles, which moves where bits land. If you decode with the real codec (custom alphabet + big-endian + per-byte bit mirror) and compare two identical items that only differ by level, you’ll see a small, stable level field change, just re-tiling and a mirrored byte next to a flag.


[10/6/2025 8:18 AM] akamoden
but this isnt by level but just an example


[10/6/2025 8:19 AM] akamoden
i 100% could be wrong and im sure maybe i am. this is how i've been going about it. and i just wanted to help


[10/6/2025 8:21 AM] nicnl
> _"BL4 serials aren’t one flat bitstring, they’re Base-85 blocks."_
I agree.

> _"Different title/parts change the mid bytes and the remainder"_
I agree.
(although the remainder MAY be a side effect of to base85 padding.)

> _"so the encoder re-tiles, which moves where bits land."_
I think you're seeing a side effect of:
- Your different base85 alphabet
- Maybe endianness (big/little endian)
- And the mirrored bits at the end

> _"If you decode with the real codec (custom alphabet + big-endian + per-byte bit mirror) and compare two identical items that only differ by level, you’ll see a small, stable level field change, just re-tiling and a mirrored byte next to a flag."_
This is not what I observed.
When I compare the same item modified to different levels (ranging from 1 to 50), I observe this:
There are 6 bits that are being changed..... and they count from `1` to `110010` in binary....... which are 1 and 50 in decimal

Does anyone know the Bit/Serial sequence for the color splash legendary perk/effect? I see people are able to mash together 4 differnt legendary perks on one item and I havent been able to get past 2

The floating 1 is just a neighboring flag bit in the same mirrored byte. The level is a 6-bit field right next to it, those six bits count 1→50. Different items can place that 6-bit field at different byte indices (per-item), but within the same item it’s stable. Re-tiling only moves where the Base-85 characters land, not the level field itself.


[10/6/2025 8:33 AM] akamoden
in short--- fields stay the same but characters move. maybe iuim a retard lol.. are we saying the same thing?


[10/6/2025 8:34 AM] akamoden
here do you have different level items that are exactly the same i can use to show a visual representaion?


[10/6/2025 8:35 AM] adozon
i saw somewhere someone made mutated lv400~ shield but it only can be exsist lost loot . 
it means level bit is over 6 bit or looks separator ? idk


[10/6/2025 8:37 AM] nicnl
the process is this:
1) Take an item, I assume it is level 50
2) BItswap it using the webtool I made, and inject the bitswapped items in your save

Here are the bitswapped variations of 50 (decimal) in binary
```
50: 110010

    v                 v
18: 010010       34: 100010

      v                 v
58: 111010       54: 110110

        v                 v
48: 110000       51: 110011
```

3) Within the mess of your inventory, you will find the level 18+34+48 variations of your level 50 item.
( 58, 54, 51 are not spawning )

4) You have discovered where 3 of the 5 level bits are.
Find where the floating 1 is ( always the `xxxx1xx` pattern) and perform all combinations from 1 to 50

=> you have your item ranging from 1 to 50 **working in game**

> _"here do you have different level items that are exactly the same i can use to show a visual representaion?"_
Yes
- Go on the webtool: https://borderlands4-serial-comparator.nicnl.com/
- Click "Load dataset" at the top
- Choose any dataset that has "Levels 1 to 50"
- Click "select all" at the top
- Click "compare 50 serials" at the top
- Scroll to the bottom to the binary comparison

to much weed and gpt 💀


[10/6/2025 8:48 AM] nicnl
Adjustment:
It seems the levels-bit are always after this binary pattern: `11001000001100`


[10/6/2025 8:50 AM] nicnl
So a revised method for changing an item level would be:
1) Open the webtool
2) Load your serial
3) Find the pattern `11001000001100xxxx1xx` where the "x" are the level bits
4) Modify those bits:   (I put a space where the floating `1` is,  so don't forget to put it back)
Level 1 is `1000 00`
Level 2 is `0100 00`
Level 3 is `1100 00`
Level 4 is `0010 00`
Level 5 is `1010 00`
...
Level 50 is `0100 11`
5) Paste your new binary string in the webtool => it will convert back to usable base85

about it , may be this thing is relate i think . i couldnt understand relation of mid and tail . we think mid is 5*n and 1~4 char is tail . because of 85^5 = 256^4

i always wondered if my decoder acutally worked how it was supposed to lmfao


[10/6/2025 9:25 AM] nicnl
there is something wrong still


[10/6/2025 9:25 AM] nicnl
sparkie's decoder is in little endian whereas it should be big endian

interesting. interesting. well at least thats settled.

we still don't know if the decoding is perfect or not


[10/6/2025 9:49 AM] nicnl
BUT


[10/6/2025 9:49 AM] nicnl
it's way better than anything we had before
--------------


[10/6/2025 9:50 AM] nicnl
i would advise you to adjust your comparison function


[10/6/2025 9:50 AM] nicnl
sometimes, stuff gets inserted inside the hex, and it pushes everything further (AKA my screen with the green lines)


[10/6/2025 9:50 AM] nicnl
this is why we implemented comparison functions that aligns matching patterns


[10/6/2025 9:51 AM] autorune
@Nicnl the problem im having is I am unable to find any sequence between 5-8 bits in length that equates to level, regardless of endianness or signed/unsigned. it doesnt make sense to use more than 8 bits given its clear they're being conservative and i cant imagine they cater for levels above 255


[10/6/2025 9:52 AM] nicnl
with your own decoding tool?


[10/6/2025 9:52 AM] akamoden
with mine. i think.


[10/6/2025 9:52 AM] autorune
that being said, didn't someone apparently get an item over level 400?


[10/6/2025 9:52 AM] autorune
with my decoding tool, which gives the same result as yours IIRC


[10/6/2025 9:52 AM] akamoden
thats just meta/UIinfo.


[10/6/2025 9:52 AM] akamoden
level 400 won't exist once you pick it up


[10/6/2025 9:52 AM] nicnl
give a serial +   either a hexstream or a bitstream


[10/6/2025 9:52 AM] akamoden
right?

i don't want to focus on those level 400 and -2 yet
since we are unable to spawn level 51 weapons, my guts says that their mangled items are overflowing data and it's fucking with the displayed level, but not the actual level

orange is the "anchor" i use to find where the level bits are : `11001000001100`


[10/6/2025 9:57 AM] nicnl
the level bits are the green ones


[10/6/2025 9:57 AM] nicnl
- Current value: `0100 11`  (space is where the floating `1` is)
- Mirror it  => `110010` => 50 decimal
    - this is a level 50 item
- We chose to forge it to level 1  => in decimal is `000001`
- Mirror  it => `100000`
- Put back the floating 1  => `1000 00` => `1000100`
- Overwrite the bits in the bitstream
- Convert the bitstream to base85 serial

Will this mean that when we inevitably get future level cap increases, we already know how to raise out existing items?


[10/6/2025 10:11 AM] nicnl
yes [if] they don't change the serial system when they raise the level cap


[10/6/2025 10:11 AM] guiltyweeb
God I hope not

at least to level 63 (`1111 11`)

we don't know where the 7th level bit is


[10/6/2025 10:12 AM] nicnl
it's probably the rightmost one : `0000 001`

@Nicnl have you even taken a look at what the engine does after edditing the level? to the serial? try a pre edit and then save and decode and get the new serial.

i'd venture out to say that items arent items, they are generated at runtime to grab from a parts lists, perks list etc.... i'd even say that epics do not have the same pools as legendaries etc.


[10/6/2025 10:49 AM] akamoden
the bits and bytes however you want to look at them... just point to these lists.


[10/6/2025 10:50 AM] nicnl
most likely yes


[10/6/2025 10:50 AM] nicnl
the serials seems to be composed with successive parts


[10/6/2025 10:50 AM] nicnl
it may be : a positional indentifier + a part identifier// or just a part identifier


[10/6/2025 10:50 AM] nicnl
this is because (by bitswapping) we obtained very strange items

We're gonna be looking somewhat similar to bl3... Maybe without a CRC given these wacky serials we've seen working

after level part , Is that useless part ? ( timestamp )
if that part from level is useless bits for game , encoder judged cut off that part ?

Varints use a bit for saying "there is more data to come" or "stop reading, last section"


[10/6/2025 11:12 AM] nicnl
However


[10/6/2025 11:12 AM] nicnl
The level 3 knife contains mostly zeroes


[10/6/2025 11:13 AM] nicnl
Let's imagine the worst case scenario, i want to encode the number zero in a varint


[10/6/2025 11:13 AM] nicnl
I could represent it like this


[10/6/2025 11:14 AM] nicnl
```
more bytes to come      last byte 
v                       v
10000000                00000000
 ^^^^^^^                 ^^^^^^^
     actual data being read  

=> 0000000  0000000
```


[10/6/2025 11:14 AM] nicnl
But..... why would we need two bytes for representing zero in a varint?
Yes it's valid, but it's wasteful


[10/6/2025 11:14 AM] nicnl
It's shorter to do this


[10/6/2025 11:15 AM] nicnl
```
last byte
v
00000000
 ^^^^^^^
   actual data

=> 0000000
```
- Still zero
- One byte shorter
- No continuation bit

it was grabbed from the game by a friend who was running a debugger or bin walk on the file, dont remember what one


[10/6/2025 11:24 AM] autorune
youre kidding lmao


[10/6/2025 11:24 AM] autorune
bruhhhh


[10/6/2025 11:25 AM] nicnl
Now there is still some alignment issues
I don't understand what section of bits the continuation bit refers to


[10/6/2025 11:26 AM] nicnl
I don't understand why somes zeroes got discarded at the end of the serial, and at the end of the level bits part
It definitely has something to with padding, because when additioning bit altered bits we get to a multiple of 8


[10/6/2025 11:27 AM] nicnl
But this is a breakthrough!!!!


[10/6/2025 11:27 AM] autorune
wouldnt that be padding to make the base85 valid?


[10/6/2025 11:27 AM] nicnl
Maybe


[10/6/2025 11:28 AM] adozon
this might be mistery of small bit shift . idk about protocol . game cut off variant . what is 000 ? is this basic feature of network protocol or gbx's feature?


[10/6/2025 11:28 AM] autorune
also bl3 did a validation of remining bytes being 0 (last 3?)


[10/6/2025 11:28 AM] nicnl
I am not sure why 5 bits got removed after the level bits though


[10/6/2025 11:28 AM] nicnl
Removing a byte from a varint would remove 8 bits


[10/6/2025 11:28 AM] autorune
yep


[10/6/2025 11:28 AM] nicnl
I'm starting to think


[10/6/2025 11:28 AM] nicnl
Is this bitstream read in reverse again?


[10/6/2025 11:29 AM] nicnl
Okay we mirrored each individual bytes


[10/6/2025 11:29 AM] nicnl
But I'm starting to feel that starting from there, the bitstream is fully mirrored from start to end


[10/6/2025 11:29 AM] nicnl
Idk


[10/6/2025 11:29 AM] nicnl
I have stuff to test


[10/6/2025 11:30 AM] autorune
what does that look like without reversing those bytes?


[10/6/2025 11:30 AM] nicnl
idk yet


[10/6/2025 11:38 AM] akamoden
Don't use padding. Use my true encoder. With conanical tails. Maybe


[10/6/2025 11:38 AM] nicnl
doesn't explain the floating 1 that disappeared


[10/6/2025 11:39 AM] nicnl
i'm absolutely convinced this is a varint phenomenon


[10/6/2025 11:40 AM] nicnl
i need to test the varint theory


[10/6/2025 11:41 AM] nicnl
supposedly the level bits "jumped around" the floating 1 when the left block got to `1111`


[10/6/2025 11:41 AM] nicnl
so


[10/6/2025 11:42 AM] nicnl
- knives from level 1 to 15 should reserialize to something shoter (the redundant varint byte gets removed)
- knives from level 16 to 50 should not (the second varint block contains useful data)


[10/6/2025 11:42 AM] nicnl
supposedly


[10/6/2025 11:42 AM] nicnl
i can't test right now


[10/6/2025 12:00 PM] akamoden
Will update my toolkit later to reflect recent changes.


[10/6/2025 12:21 PM] autorune
i might tinker with it myself, can you ping the serial and which bits we're looking at here?


[10/6/2025 12:41 PM] nicnl
```
Edited level 3:   @Ugr$WBm/!L#!X=5&qXxA;nj3OOD#<4R
Reserialized:     @Ugr$WBm/zAGE=hzQHK_H`+>k3$Nj?D
```


[10/6/2025 12:42 PM] autorune
what did you mean by reserialized btw


[10/6/2025 12:46 PM] nicnl
- inject the knife in a save
- load up the game
- extract the knife from the save
=> the serial got shorter, but the item is still perfectly identical in-game


[10/6/2025 12:46 PM] nicnl
i think this is due to varints


[10/6/2025 12:47 PM] autorune
oh, so the game does in fact deserialize and reserialize


[10/6/2025 12:47 PM] autorune
neat


[10/6/2025 12:47 PM] autorune
im not sure comparing the two will tell us much though


[10/6/2025 12:48 PM] autorune
whats throwing my off is, why would bit 5 of a 7 bit integer be the continuation bit


[10/6/2025 12:49 PM] nicnl
we noticed that the level-bits are moving around


[10/6/2025 12:49 PM] nicnl
different items have it at different places


[10/6/2025 12:49 PM] nicnl
theory: the actual varint may be non-aligned, because it was writen when the cursor was already non aligned


[10/6/2025 12:50 PM] nicnl
this is just a theory, i have others to test


[10/6/2025 12:51 PM] autorune
yeah i think theres more to it


[10/6/2025 12:52 PM] its_pasha77
question: how do I build my own  modded weapon?


[10/6/2025 1:05 PM] inflamedsebi
I noticed the reserialization on low level items as well, but couldn‘t wrap my head around it. My guess was, some parts might not be allowed to generate a low level, thus getting removed.


[10/6/2025 1:05 PM] nicnl
i checked


[10/6/2025 1:06 PM] nicnl
the reserialization at low level only happens on level 15 and lower
which is exactly when the level bits are not going past the "floating 1"


[10/6/2025 1:06 PM] nicnl
this stinks of a continuation bit


[10/6/2025 1:07 PM] inflamedsebi
The continuation bit absolutely makes sense, but increase the scope! It might not be a continuation be for the level, but for the whole header!
So each byte in the header should have this bit! Thats why some gear does habe more headers than others!


[10/6/2025 1:08 PM] nicnl
hmm


[10/6/2025 1:10 PM] inflamedsebi
Buyback adds header data, doesnt it?
So if we take a low level gun where the bit is 0 and make a  buyback to add header data, the bit should be back again, right?

Unless buyback is not header data….


[10/6/2025 1:10 PM] nicnl
idk


[10/6/2025 1:10 PM] nicnl
personally i'm gonna exclude the buyback from the equation right now


[10/6/2025 1:11 PM] nicnl
the buyback was super useful for figuring out the base85 decoding


[10/6/2025 1:11 PM] nicnl
but right now eeeeh


[10/6/2025 1:11 PM] nicnl
i wanna understand what the FUCK is happening with the level bits


[10/6/2025 1:11 PM] nicnl
i may have an idea, i'm testing combinations


[10/6/2025 1:12 PM] inflamedsebi
But a continuation bit just for 2 bits, is insane … well maybe not as insane as mirror each single byte :borderlands4:


[10/6/2025 1:12 PM] nicnl
:PES2_Shrug:


[10/6/2025 1:12 PM] nicnl
yes


[10/6/2025 1:12 PM] nicnl
mirroring bytes was insane too


[10/6/2025 1:13 PM] nicnl
unaligned bitstreams are insane as well


[10/6/2025 1:13 PM] nicnl
i don't know what to believe so i'm trying anything at this point


[10/6/2025 1:18 PM] nicnl
fucking hell


[10/6/2025 1:18 PM] nicnl
i got it


[10/6/2025 1:19 PM] nicnl
okay so basically


[10/6/2025 1:25 PM] nicnl
Our level "pattern" looks like this, right? `LLLL1LL` 
(the L stands for the level bits)
My theory is that the 1 is a continuation bit.

Observations:
1) When the item is under 16 ( `1111` and lower ) the serial gets shortened
2) When this happens, the mystery bit gets set to zero.
2) **The next five bits are removed.**
=> Does that mean we are looking at...** 5bits varints ???! (wtf)**
It matches our `LLLL1` pattern which is 5 bits though.


Experiment:
```
We observed this:  10001 00000
Gets truncated to: 10000

Can we add another 5bit varint?
New level bits:    10001 00001 00000
```


[10/6/2025 1:26 PM] nicnl
Result:
```
A longer serial:
@Ugr$WBm/!LZM7SgodeorSM{`52NG16M

That gets reserialized to the zero-continuation bit
@Ugr$WBm/zAGE=hzQHK_H`+>k3$Nj?D
```


[10/6/2025 1:27 PM] nicnl
Are we really looking at 5bits varints?


[10/6/2025 1:27 PM] nicnl
i'm gonna try and stack this pattern


[10/6/2025 1:30 PM] nicnl
it. works.


[10/6/2025 1:36 PM] nicnl
They all collapse to the first one.

[10/6/2025 1:38 PM] nicnl
-------------
Second observation
- Adding 5th zero-varint does NOT work
  - it collapses to a level zero corrupted item
- Four varints of 5 bits means... 4*4=16 bits of useful data


[10/6/2025 1:39 PM] nicnl
Here I go
Here is my hot take:


[10/6/2025 1:39 PM] nicnl
The item level is a 5-bit varint that can go up to 4 blocks for storing 16 useful bits total


[10/6/2025 1:48 PM] nicnl
FUCKING. WIN.

So does it use this method of bit compression everywhere or only for levels?

[10/6/2025 2:03 PM] nicnl
i've focused only on the level part


[10/6/2025 2:04 PM] superexboom
so based on the current progress, modifying the levels of other weapons should only take a little time to complete?


[10/6/2025 2:05 PM] nicnl
a big mystery remains:  depending on the weapon, the position of the levels bits seems to move

as a workaround, I can "guess" the position using a bitmask
not perfect but it'll work until more stuff is figured out


[10/6/2025 2:06 PM] nicnl
i think i can code two things:
1) a level indicator when you paste a serial in my webtool
2) a feature to edit the level of a serial

We’ll be fun to try the special promo items out at max level


[10/6/2025 2:28 PM] thatdonfc
How might someone use this to determine the location for other items? Then we can try to see if they change based on manufacturer, weapon type, all of the above etc.


[10/6/2025 2:28 PM] nicnl
I don't know.


[10/6/2025 2:29 PM] nicnl

There is a LOT of stuff to do, and we have to start somewhere right?


[10/6/2025 2:31 PM] autorune
It'll be determined by some other variant + x bytes/bits


[10/6/2025 2:33 PM] thatdonfc
I mean, it would be very helpful to at least figure out the level locations for each manufacturer of one weapon type like SMG, AR or Pistol


[10/6/2025 2:34 PM] valhallan_
There’s some assumptions in there I think?


[10/6/2025 2:34 PM] orinx
Well you can know what the bits are for any level and look for them, it will help if you have lower level items to compare with.


[10/6/2025 2:50 PM] superexboom
But you also need to acquire weapons with the same skills for comparison?

[10/6/2025 3:06 PM] orinx
Not that hard with legendaries and I don’t think everything need to be the same just. Close enough to have level in the same area.


[10/6/2025 3:06 PM] superexboom
If we assume that other types of weapons aren't serialized in a  weird way, perhaps we only need the same weapons, not the same skills, but varying levels? Perhaps something unique?

This is the equivalent of: _"oh no, this website is slow... quick, throw more CPU and memory at it!"_
In the IT field, "throwing more at it" is never a good solution to a misuse of the technology
(eg: bad SQL request, or here throwing garbage data into LLMs and hoping it'll take the stars out of the sky.)

@Nicnl so a while ago it was said "/)}}" was responsible for a level 50 weapon... I've just tested your method successfully with a few serials. Picking up 2 5-bit blocks to create an 8 bit int with the level starting at bit 31 ->
```
@Ugr$xKm/)}}$pj({_X>Jcq0UExO{SqiosR~Z6aW
```
but
```
@Ugr$xKm/)
```
is the shortest I can make the string before losing the level, so the }} must denote something else (if we put the walker on immediately after the level, we get another 2x4 equalling 98 - 0001**1**0001**0**)


[10/6/2025 4:09 PM] nicnl
> with the level starting at bit 31
knowing the level bits can move around, eeeeh


[10/6/2025 4:09 PM] nicnl
what do you want to do with this serial exactly?


[10/6/2025 4:09 PM] autorune
yeah bit 31 is specific to this small subset of serials


[10/6/2025 4:09 PM] nicnl
maybe i can do it for you and write a step by step


[10/6/2025 4:10 PM] autorune
i mean end-goal is an all out editor but want to understand it and ideally help with the efforts 😄


[10/6/2025 4:13 PM] autorune
there's gotta be a flag sooner in the headersthat says where level's gonna be


[10/6/2025 4:14 PM] autorune
quite likely something similar to the bit length vs DB version in bl3


[10/6/2025 4:15 PM] nicnl
```
Step 1:
Raw serial: @Ugr$xKm/)}}$pj({_X>Jcq0UExO{SqiosR~Z6aW


Step 2: extract the first bits using the webtool:
00100001101001010111000101100000000110010000011000100111000001001001001100100000010


Step 3: workaround for finding the level bits, search for this string: 00000011001000001100
Found here:
00100001101001010111000101100000000110010000011000100111000001001001001100100000010
                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Step 4: the level bits are right after the marker
00100001101001010111000101100000000110010000011000100111000001001001001100100000010
                             --------------------LLLLc
       continuation bit=1, we must read 5 more bits -|


Step 5: continuation bit was 1, we must continue
00100001101001010111000101100000000110010000011000100111000001001001001100100000010
                             -------------------------LLLLc
                     continuation bit=0, we done reading -|


Step 4: assemble the data
LLLLc LLLc: 01001 11000

Step 5: discard the continuation bit, we don't need them anymore
LLLL  LLLL: 0100  1100

Step 6: reverse the string:
01001100 => 00110010

Step 7: binary to decimal
00110010 => 50
```

[10/6/2025 4:17 PM] autorune
I skipped the reversal then


[10/6/2025 4:20 PM] nicnl
yeah the reversal is weird, it's part of how varints work though I think


[10/6/2025 4:21 PM] nicnl
from raw serial to reading the level... it requires so many mirroring! LMAO

it works with the 30 or so weapons I have, but not with the matador for some reason

```


[10/6/2025 4:41 PM] autorune
so im getting the same result without reversing any bits


[10/6/2025 4:42 PM] autorune
or is this result without inverting the bits during decode?


[10/6/2025 4:44 PM] nicnl
with the webtool?
during decode you have to keep byte order on  `0123` and `reverse bits: yes`


[10/6/2025 4:44 PM] nicnl
if you don't, depending on where the level bit align, they'll be spread far apart


[10/6/2025 4:45 PM] nicnl
example with the aramid gcx
level bits are matching our "LLLLc" pattern

then i'll see if I have enough time left to do the encoding (encoding is a bit more tricky, as it requires to pad the end of the serial until the bits can be divided by 8)

[10/6/2025 5:15 PM] nicnl
basically, the bits that governs the level are positioned "kinda" randomly
(there MUST be a logic to it, but we haven't figured it out yet)

as a workaround, i'm searching for a known "marker", after which the bit levels are

this specific page doesn't need to be fed into GPT, the decoding is "intermediary" stuff that LLMs don't need to know

@Nicnl I took that level 30 serial and made 2 further copies, at lvl 50 and 100... 100 got picked up as invalid and binned but the 50 works 😄

implications for Our Mutation Engine:
This changes everything! 
Why our mutations work - We're preserving the Base85 structure
Why some mutations fail - We might be breaking the bit alignment
How to improve mutations - We can decode → modify raw data → re-encode

[10/6/2025 6:05 PM] inflamedsebi
So remember the buyback? it did add 10 bit of data, so 2 4 bit segments with continuity bit ....
I wonder if the whole serial might be 4+1 in general ...
Which would allow them to start reading the data from the back, since they can determine the size, and padding just by looking at the overall lenght+


[10/6/2025 6:05 PM] alienfreek
ive had a theory from the start that they have no idea how the codes work themselves :kekw: gotta be why the lost loot machine doesnt function right

could easily be dead wrong tho


[10/6/2025 6:17 PM] inflamedsebi
its not wrong.
same with bit mirroring.
they stuck with old habbits.
We dont have item encryption to, but the whole sevefile is encrypted by your player id
So we might need to figure out, what stayed and what changed and imo we were doing a great job even tho wi didn't know it was so similar to bl3 :PepeBrain:


[10/6/2025 6:21 PM] autorune
im thinking it could be a lot more similar to bl3 but using varbits instead of the itemdb type thing now


[10/6/2025 6:31 PM] inflamedsebi
Just looked through the ending bits of serials
```
...|4bit|4bitV
...1000111000000000000
...  >< byte >< byte >
```
After the last continuity bit with 0 they are padding to the full byte. and stop. This keeps happening with all serials i have.

and this 4+1 pattern absolutely makes sense with this data structure.
* they can determine the padding and the amount of data without reading and parsing the data.
* big and small values get stored quite efficiently with this 4 bit token size
*reverting the bitstream suddenly makes sense with this, since you can simply keep reading 5 bits sequences without doing a lookahead on how much data is read in.

all this suddenly has a good reason! they are not just morrons xD


[10/6/2025 6:32 PM] autorune
yep those zeroes are just padding to make up the b85


[10/6/2025 6:33 PM] inflamedsebi
well yes, but not all of them and we can now easily determine which are padding and which are data 🙂

also wasnt there a serial floating around at like lvl400


[10/6/2025 6:56 PM] inflamedsebi
@Nicnl can you do me a favor?
in your tool, instead of having a base4 representation, could you display the parsed data?
```
function hexToBase4(hex) {
    const bin = hexToBin(hex);
    const values = [];
    let currentSegments = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < bin.length; i += 5) {
        const segment = bin.slice(i, i + 5);
        if (segment.length < 5) break; // ignore incomplete

        currentSegments.push(segment);
        const cont = segment[4]; // continuity bit

        if (cont === '0') {
            // Value complete -> parse
            const bits = currentSegments
                .map(s => s.slice(0, 4)) // remove continuity bits
                .join('');
            const reversed = bits.split('').reverse().join('');
            const value = parseInt(reversed, 2);
            values.push(value);
            currentSegments = [];
        }
    }

    return values.join(' ');
}
```
this should do the trick if you replace the existing function


[10/6/2025 6:57 PM] inflamedsebi
not sure if you have to exclude this from the pattern matching tho ^^


[10/6/2025 7:00 PM] nicnl
i've hidden the base4 like 15 minutes ago


[10/6/2025 7:00 PM] nicnl
with the 5-bit varing fuckery, i figured it wasn't aligned to base4 anyway

[10/6/2025 7:01 PM] nicnl
i'm not sure what your js function does


[10/6/2025 7:01 PM] inflamedsebi
well its not base 4 any more, but the actual data behind the 4+1


[10/6/2025 7:01 PM] nicnl
what is the difference?


[10/6/2025 7:01 PM] inflamedsebi
im just parsing the 4+1 to the actual decimal data

[10/6/2025 7:02 PM] nicnl
but, yeah, if you want


[10/6/2025 7:04 PM] inflamedsebi
so there may be an actual header before the 4+1 sequence?

this is correct

@Nicnl  this is funking weird


[10/6/2025 7:36 PM] nicnl
it's hard to tell if anything is a varint or not


[10/6/2025 7:37 PM] autorune
oh absolutely


[10/6/2025 7:37 PM] nicnl
blocks of 5 bits are, well... everywhere


[10/6/2025 7:38 PM] nicnl
though we can make some speculations about this


[10/6/2025 7:38 PM] autorune
absolutely

1) i've tried a 5block varint for the level => did not work
my interpretation: 4 blocks of 5 varints gives... 16bits of useful data => a `int16`  
this is not a coincidence i think


[10/6/2025 7:39 PM] nicnl
2) it means there can be 4 "forms" of varints
one block, two blocks, three blocks, four blocks


[10/6/2025 7:40 PM] nicnl
```
4bits of data:   ----0
8bits of data:   ----1  ----0
12bits of data:  ----1  ----1  ----0
16bits of data:  ----1  ----1  ----1  ----0
```

those `1` and `0` are ALWAYS going to be there for those sizes of varints


[10/6/2025 7:41 PM] nicnl
this may help figuring out where common parts start and end

i mean, if they work with varint, the might work with other var data types as well, so for example, the header might be a varstring or soemting, so the have a variable size datafield just before the data.


[10/6/2025 7:55 PM] autorune
my fuckin implementation is wrong clearly


[10/6/2025 7:55 PM] autorune
its picking the repkit as lvl30


[10/6/2025 7:56 PM] autorune
wait its doing that with yours too @Nicnl


[10/6/2025 7:57 PM] inflamedsebi
what is the repkits actual level?


[10/6/2025 7:57 PM] autorune
fuck sake


[10/6/2025 7:57 PM] autorune
im restarted then


[10/6/2025 8:00 PM] inflamedsebi
What if we do the same approach like we did to figure the level marker?
just bitswap the bits before the level and check wht bits are used for what?
so we might sort out the manufactuerer and item time so we have more data in this section?


[10/6/2025 8:00 PM] autorune
i used the same serial twice lmaoo


[10/6/2025 8:00 PM] autorune
welp the repkit is gone


[10/6/2025 8:02 PM] nicnl
if we discover floating `1` bits, it can only mean one thing


[10/6/2025 8:03 PM] autorune
right, i copied the repkit serial wrong thats why


[10/6/2025 8:03 PM] autorune
got it back tho

well one thing to keep in mind is what parts are on it. Having CoV mag as part does change way more as example


[10/6/2025 9:53 PM] anro_19
I do say that the parts do have a way more impact on the entire thing because of the way there are. With this i mean there change things on the whole gun that it can actually fit on it.


[10/6/2025 9:54 PM] anro_19
i do believe it also apply to some variation like grips etc if you considering Bonny and Clyde which is the most easy weapon to study on it as it does not have any parts and only role with damage and crit difference


[10/6/2025 9:57 PM] anro_19
One thing i also notice as example are CoV or Ripper Parts. If you start erasing the serial it starts removing parts of the weapon most of the time it start removing first the buttstock => grip => fire trigger => barrel to 95% of the time while on weapons without it start erasing the parts like jakobs or the legendary itself


[10/6/2025 9:58 PM] anro_19
base on this i would say if you have a effect which require physical change on a weapon it will shift this parts of the weapon to the end
