!!!! IMPORTANT !!!
You must have a ChatGPT account to upload the files.
 
New GPT link with Brain By @Dura / Clanker https://chatgpt.com/share/68e1f3b6-0734-8010-8ea8-80366ec20405
I believe you must pay for ChatGPT to use gpt5 thinking.

Startup video made by @Fearless  https://youtu.be/pUJnXxKFmI0

Basic Startup for Modifying Serials

Here’s a simple workflow you can use to get started:

1. Copy/paste Step 1 into ChatGPT.

2. Send it Step 2.

3. Paste in the startup prompt (explains how ChatGPT should generate serials).

4. Use Step 4 to ask ChatGPT for specific serial mutations.

Example YAML Output

When you ask ChatGPT for serials, it should return a .yaml block that looks something like this:

state:
  inventory:
    items:
      backpack:
        slot_0:
          serial: '@Uge8Cmm/)}}!uW2WI;cvuFsK&>wbGzc9Ms8!DxpxnQ?;XsB6I)'
          state_flags: 3
        slot_1:
          serial: '@Uge8Cmm/)}}$pj({l?bYXs#G{s3xir/P$>@T<UzeKs1gcQJDMmGM/'
          state_flags: 3
        slot_2:
          serial: '@Ugr$xKm/)}}$pj({_X>Jcq0UExO{SqiosR~Z6aW'
          state_flags: 3
        slot_3:
          serial: '@Uge8Usm/)}}$pj)yuMCRR`*MONb*T5z>=3%500'
          state_flags: 3



How to Use

Copy everything starting from the two spaces before inventory: and paste it into:
👉 https://iyre.github.io/bl4-save-tools/

Important:

If the inventory structure is invalid, your save will become corrupt.

If the serials themselves are invalid, your character may fail to load.

In this case, go back to the main menu and log in again — the game will “load” your save and move invalid serials to unknown items.

If your game crashes outright, that means you’ve got a truly broken serial. Best bet is to throw those away and try different ones.

If a particular crashing serial is important to you, ChatGPT can sometimes help debug why it’s failing and suggest mutations.


That’s it!
Any feedback is welcome — and good luck & happy modding!

– Matt

My first successful mod came away worse of but was different I have been feeding what results the code change help towards.

I have found batches of say 5-10 see what pops up in lost loot and inform ChatGPT of any new items and the new code that comes from it.

Thank you for clarifying. I must’ve gotten a broken batch last night that kept crashing my game on launch. I tried to delete the serials but it continued to crash :cryingmansad:

[10/2/2025 11:59 PM] tfk_yun
how did you get gpt to output that tho like what did you tell or ask to get that


[10/3/2025 12:07 AM] mattmab
its a mix of hand editing and gpt mutations

That's just kinda future proving, I'm not sure if people are able to get the certain serials for specific items, But eventually, That will be able to just implement the attachment/whatever else to it.

@Yun 악마 tbh i have been lengthining serials by hand then using chatgpt to mutate the skills on the class mod then extending manually again after gpt mutates.


[10/3/2025 12:15 AM] unkempt3329
@Mattmab , If you have anymore code you'd be willing to share to get the one I've been sharing up to date, I would appreciate that. 🙂 
I do have the code you shared earlier so if there's no more than that, Than it's okay!

These words may have fixed the wall i have hit with gpt I'm have to test lol

@Unkempt best explination is i took one of my seed serials

```@Ug!pHG2__CA41ms/KJ_=%$DrP)+8NYdgKC>vm#Q62i5zj6A%*^+{-XY(UZc*XN~7+fN~7+f{-FM%{-R2w?xFsmUZc*X?xHrD7m^g07Z`$a64EFaDjX{OL4`v#DlRHU>V2x6LG3cAG^szRzo@^c*Qj%;(x`i=(x`i=Kd8T`zo^ovd#FFC*Qj%;yQq!kg(Su01%{xUgtRcqg$joXe^B92$DrP)+8NYdgKC>vm#Q62i5zj6A%*^+{-XY(UZc*XN~7+fN~7+f{-FM%{-R2w?xFsmUZc*X?xHrD7m^g07Z`$a64EFaDjX{OL4`v#DlRHU>V2x6LG3cAG^szRzo@^c*Qj%;(x`i=(x`i=Kd8T`zo^ovd#FFC*Qj%;yQq!kg(Su01%{xUgtRcqg$joXe^B92kpK```



broke it apart to 
Header
```Ug!pHG2__CA41ms/KJ_=%$```
midsection
```$DrP)+8NYdgKC>vm#Q62i5zj6A%*^+{-XY(UZc*XN~7+fN~7+f{-FM%{-R2w?xFsmUZc*X?xHrD7m^g07Z`$a64EFaDjX{OL4`v#DlRHU>V2x6LG3cAG^szRzo@^c*Qj%;(x`i=(x`i=Kd8T`zo^ovd#FFC*Qj%;yQq!kg(Su01%{xUgtRcqg$joXe^B92$DrP)+8NYdgKC>vm#Q62i5zj6A%*^+{-XY(UZc*XN~7+fN~7+f{-FM%{-R2w?xFsmUZc*X?xHrD7m^g07Z`$a64EFaDjX{OL4`v#DlRHU>V2x6LG3cAG^szRzo@^c*Qj%;(x`i=(x`i=Kd8T`zo^ovd#FFC*Qj%;yQq!kg(Su01%{xUgtRcqg$joXe^B92```
Tail
```kpK```


i clone the midsection a ton

so Header Mid Mid Mid Mid Mid Tail


[10/3/2025 12:20 AM] mattmab
load it into the game


[10/3/2025 12:21 AM] mattmab
then grab the current serial


[10/3/2025 12:21 AM] mattmab
then send to chatgpt for mutations


[10/3/2025 12:21 AM] mattmab
look through its results


[10/3/2025 12:21 AM] mattmab
take the best findings and hand edit again. Header Mid Mid Mid Mid Mid Tail


[10/3/2025 12:22 AM] mattmab
rinse and repeat


[10/3/2025 12:22 AM] cyber710
Is there a way to search said results more effectively i be getting like 6k 7k items


[10/3/2025 12:23 AM] unkempt3329
So what are the "best findings" going to look like? Is the serials just long?


[10/3/2025 12:23 AM] mattmab
if there isnt a state flag its considered a "new" item and is "unseen" meaning it has a ! in the inventory untill you look at it. 
state_flag 1 = "seen" 
state_flag 3 = Favorite 
state_flag 5 = Trash 
state_flag 17 = Tag group 1 
state_flag 33 = Tag group 2 
state_flag 65 = Tag group 3 
state_flag 129 = Tag group 4


[10/3/2025 12:23 AM] mattmab
you can have chatgpt tag the items like this for sorting in the inventory


[10/3/2025 12:24 AM] mattmab
unfortunately  looking at the items is the slowest part


[10/3/2025 12:24 AM] mattmab
but generally more mods is more value


[10/3/2025 12:25 AM] tfk_yun
im assuming this kinda stuff only works on class mods ?


[10/3/2025 12:25 AM] unkempt3329
So, With what I've been using, I can target the tail length, It's been going off of everything that's been put it here, Is higher better?


[10/3/2025 12:25 AM] cyber710
So like tag group 3 I think is the most heavy mutated stuff so prolly go through there first


[10/3/2025 12:26 AM] mattmab
im thinking it will work on everything honestly


[10/3/2025 12:26 AM] mattmab
just found the method with the class mod


[10/3/2025 12:26 AM] mattmab
honestly smoked a bowl and started making craked items ngl!


[10/3/2025 12:26 AM] cyber710
Ohhh so that's the secret


[10/3/2025 12:26 AM] cyber710
Lol


[10/3/2025 12:26 AM] tfk_yun
so you making all the new mid sections thats where the "roles" are ?


[10/3/2025 12:27 AM] mattmab
seems to be so


[10/3/2025 12:27 AM] mattmab
i broke a serial apart and just started removing sections and was able to see the perks dropping


[10/3/2025 12:27 AM] cyber710
How did you guys pull the chats into html files for gpt


[10/3/2025 12:27 AM] cyber710
That's little off topic lol but thought it was cool


[10/3/2025 12:27 AM] tfk_yun
im just trying to figure out how to put legendary traits on other guns

There was a shotgun in another channel than has infinite damage due to the same repeat. does that mean any weapon could be set to infinite if a specific group is repeated?


[10/3/2025 12:32 AM] mattmab
seems like 5x is a sweet spot to get a "max roll"

Like do you delete a section of the code see what disappears or take a section paste to another weapon

i  started deleting the tail 4 spaces at a time and verifying if the items still spawned in and what perks were lost with what 4 characters i deleted

No, With the gemini code generator I have some known serials it pulls from to try and add parts and whatnot


[10/3/2025 12:42 AM] cyber710
Ahhh I tried breaking down serials and logging the blocks and what they do and giving gpt that info

@Scoob probably possible but mutations are pretty much random other than lengthening serials. I proved that today.


[10/3/2025 1:01 AM] scoob01474
So I could try shaving down the stray id to find what that talent is and smack it onto a smg?


[10/3/2025 1:02 AM] scoob01474
Or I could do the same thing how you are making vex mods to another characters class mod?

The mutation engine is rough right now but its a WIP; If you give it working serial codes, "It being the AI" It trys to pull items from the those guns and add them to the generated guns/items they make.

The engine IS updated, I recommed using already modded serials, It gives the better outputs, the TG1.TG2.TG3 section is to indicate how much of each you want it to generate, Have fun! 🙂

yeah I made a few 160m, though the recharge rate is kind of bummer. the ones under a million seem to have the best balance so far of recharge rate and demi-god capacity. Is there any quick way to insta recharge your shield in bl4?

Maybe a modded stim?


[10/3/2025 2:04 AM] unkempt3329
There are some that instantly start charging it


[10/3/2025 2:07 AM] karate.chop
oh neat! I noticed there were a good amount of health related repkits, wasn't sure about shield related ones. I'll dig through some now and see if I can come up with anything to pair with one of those shields 👍

Where would you put the talent in the new string if you did that method Scoob mentioned, also you said you take the tail 4 characters off every instance?

if there isnt a state flag its considered a "new" item and is "unseen" meaning it has a ! in the inventory untill you look at it. 
state_flag 1 = "seen" 
state_flag 3 = Favorite 
state_flag 5 = Trash 
state_flag 17 = Tag group 1 
state_flag 33 = Tag group 2 
state_flag 65 = Tag group 3 
state_flag 129 = Tag group 4

I actually had a question about this too, when I told gpt to do this it renamed the state flag to  “Tag Group 4” for instance is this correct approach or will that cause issues?


[10/3/2025 9:27 AM] mattmab
as long as you tell it this
```if there isnt a state flag its considered a "new" item and is "unseen" meaning it has a ! in the inventory untill you look at it. 
state_flag 1 = "seen" 
state_flag 3 = Favorite 
state_flag 5 = Trash 
state_flag 17 = Tag group 1 
state_flag 33 = Tag group 2 
state_flag 65 = Tag group 3 
state_flag 129 = Tag group 4```

added a perk


[10/3/2025 9:31 AM] sinofazrael
By clone do you mean just copy pasting onto the end of the string?


[10/3/2025 9:32 AM] mattmab
that was in the middle


[10/3/2025 9:33 AM] thedarkness1404
its still giving me nan im going the g.m.r


[10/3/2025 9:33 AM] mattmab
Header
```@Ug#2fK2}```
Tail
```t#GDkK```


[10/3/2025 9:33 AM] mattmab
working in the middle seems to have the best results


[10/3/2025 9:33 AM] mattmab
extending the middle and leaving tails and headers alone


[10/3/2025 9:34 AM] sinofazrael
'@Ug#2fK2}TYgOuY_gW60GgW8/UXHYc^YNkQ0IH;EgRXdt#GDkK6'

so in this string when you started removing things you notice it changes once EgRXdt#GDkK6 is gone, so from there you’d learn what? Sorry im slow


[10/3/2025 9:35 AM] sinofazrael
I guess my question also is why did you remove the tail first in that example, once the tail was gone it made the one perk go down a digit


[10/3/2025 9:37 AM] sinofazrael
I appreciate the help sorry for all the questions/clairifications

@Mattmab huge W bro 🙌so to make that one you started with

 '@Ug#2fK2}TYgOuY_gW60GgW8/UXHYc^YNkQ0IH;EgRXdt#GDkK6'

then just copy pasted the mid section
So it would be like

'@Ug#2fK2}TYgOuY_gW60GgW8/UXHYc^YNkQ0IH;EgRXd TYgOuY_gW60GgW8/UXHYc^YNkQ0IHt#GDkK6' 

For example or did i miss something?

For those hitting walls chat GPT is dumb as only started making decent progress today. When you ask it to create random codes it doesent take into account how the structures work.

Give base codes and successful long ones but tell it "When I say create random codes create them based on the structure of the unsuccessful serials/codes generated" as AI is dumb.

The AI thought at one point a class mod modified with no mods and no skill points was a normal drop 🤣


[10/3/2025 12:01 PM] unkempt3329
@Mattmab; I updated mine with those TWO things you posted earlier to tell it, and now it gives me an extra 2k items, thank you.

As for the tail length does it matter?


[10/3/2025 3:59 PM] hobamj
can you also have it just ouput the serials only?


[10/3/2025 4:04 PM] unkempt3329
I haven't gone over 1k.


[10/3/2025 4:05 PM] unkempt3329
It's easier to leave them in, If you want to tell it to do that just hit "copy canvas" and the AI will pop up for you to edit it!


[10/3/2025 4:47 PM] ivviimcmxcix
Anyone else had success with repeating segments over and over? So far I got it to work on a songbird, pushing 1 mil. Right now I'm trying on a potato thrower but even the exact same ones seem to have different serials.


[10/3/2025 4:50 PM] mattmab
yes each has unique serials generally


[10/3/2025 4:51 PM] mattmab
but we are finding sections we can splice from ones to others

I haven't had much luck outside of a pre modded song bird I saw a single repetition in , I just added extra repetitions and it jumped from 90k to 1,500k DPS I'm trying to do the Slutty Potato thrower now but it's not having it.

i understand the stacking of prts i modded long time on BL3 but with an editor the bit and bytes are a bit harder


[10/4/2025 3:02 AM] whiteshark2020
like for example if i would copy ```DpHY(RHPymsYpdCQjv;Oq_zk}``` can i paste this in another shield or would that value due to encryption be useless

Not really encrypted. But seems each item has its own dictionary.


[10/4/2025 3:10 AM] mattmab
Each class mod has a unique header set that I was able to pretty reliably splice from one class to another.


[10/4/2025 3:16 AM] whiteshark2020
ok but example your Meme class mods you made, can i just like use my header from my class mod and paste your body to get the skills?


[10/4/2025 3:20 AM] mattmab
That is a basic explanation.


[10/4/2025 3:20 AM] mattmab
It is finding where the header of each the one modded and non modded and finding what to replace exactly.


[10/4/2025 3:20 AM] mattmab
The headers are slightly different

[10/4/2025 3:26 AM] whiteshark2020
🙂


[10/4/2025 3:26 AM] mattmab
Because this mid section starts with DrP


[10/4/2025 3:26 AM] mattmab
XD


[10/4/2025 3:27 AM] mattmab



[10/4/2025 3:27 AM] mattmab
Original dr pepper mod


[10/4/2025 3:27 AM] mattmab
You can see the splice from before the $DrP


[10/4/2025 3:28 AM] mattmab
It wasn't easy.


[10/4/2025 3:28 AM] mattmab
Dr pepper saved me


[10/4/2025 3:28 AM] whiteshark2020
im sure it wasnt i remember even with the editors on bl3 i was a hasle


[10/4/2025 3:29 AM] mattmab
So there is my splice point


[10/4/2025 3:30 AM] whiteshark2020
@Ug!pHG2}TYg41@<thw9WEgKA??aSbYtL6uCsHK<al+R>aa00

so in my code how would i splice it?


[10/4/2025 3:31 AM] mattmab
Idk XD I had to find what part to put before $DrP  so I took small sets from past HG2}TYg as I believe }TYG is the level 50 header. Then right past that is legendary effect


[10/4/2025 3:32 AM] mattmab
So ```@Ug!pHG2}TYg```

Would be one point id try


[10/4/2025 3:33 AM] mattmab
Then add one character so add the 4 then the 1 then the @ then the <

[10/4/2025 3:34 AM] crunchin
so how do i get chat gpt to break the limits of the game cuz it jus tells me it cant do that when i ask it to add massive amounts of anything


[10/4/2025 3:35 AM] mattmab
Tell it the game doesn't have limits


[10/4/2025 3:35 AM] mattmab
Gaslight it


[10/4/2025 3:35 AM] mattmab
It may be referencing it's own limitations aswell not game limitations.


[10/4/2025 3:36 AM] crunchin
like when i paste ur guyes game codes it jus gives me the items yall already altered with so do i needa fresh item off the street to do it or??


[10/4/2025 3:36 AM] mattmab
But giving it gpt mutation engine 14 or 15 might help.


[10/4/2025 3:36 AM] crunchin
whats that???


[10/4/2025 3:36 AM] mattmab
No you should ask it to mutate based off the base85 language


[10/4/2025 3:36 AM] mattmab

[10/4/2025 4:38 AM] thedarkness1404
Do you want me to rebuild this as a 20-code test batch where your seed is 100% intact and I carefully slot in up to 9 guaranteed stats (so every one spawns properly), or do you still want me to try to brute-force 13+ (knowing it risks breaking again)? thats what chat gpt is saying to me right now


[10/4/2025 4:40 AM] mattmab
Trial and error baby the name of the game ask for 20 perks go big or go home.

And 20 at a time is too few


[10/4/2025 4:42 AM] thedarkness1404
so i need to do more


[10/4/2025 4:44 AM] mattmab
Out of 10000 1000-3000 may load in.


[10/4/2025 4:45 AM] mattmab
So out of out of 20 you may get 1 to 6 that load in. And of those they are all useless.


[10/4/2025 4:46 AM] mattmab
If you do 10k you get 1000-3000 or more and say 80% of those are junk but 20% are interesting and 1% is useful.


[10/4/2025 4:47 AM] thedarkness1404

for class mods...
Consistent Red Skill Characters:
g → Always produces orange skull +2
4 → Produces orange leaf +1 AND orange boot +7 (position-dependent!)
/ → Produces orange shield +4
0 → Produces orange empty +3

Key Findings:
Position matters! Character 4 produces different red skills based on position:
Position 4: Orange leaf +1
Position 6: Orange boot +7 (highest bonus!)

Consistent red characters:
g → Orange skull +2
4 → Orange skills (position-dependent)
/ → Orange shield +4
0 → Orange empty +3
trying  making a full red class mod

i can share you this it runs from within the folder, theres a yaml file included that you might want to replace with sum more conveniant
@thedarkness 
basicly it was messing with generating WILD items
so i specified that the serial was a header DO NOT TOUCH
a body consisting of many or single parts.
and a tail
then i asked to identify the parts

[10/4/2025 2:59 PM] duke7000
In some ways I wish I didnt start with your way instead setting rules like

This is how many weapon types are in game ....manufactures ect and so on so it had a reference database started then started feeding it codes that way with targeted farming 🤣 
Then started building them.
I am in too deep to be bothered now 🤣

I was a beginner when I made the original post so 🤷 lol

thats fair and also realised those two files I made in text format may have help the upload file workaround but lost out with no images to compare to codes.

count from right to left and keep in mind some are stacks so you will only see point going up or stats


[10/4/2025 4:17 PM] whiteshark2020
im just done with part 1 i have 1 red of each, so now i xan choose part 2 and see what changes where i will use 1 mod with a red on the right spot as seed


[10/4/2025 4:17 PM] whiteshark2020
if skill 2 doesnt move... then its stats or point i need keep eye on

[10/4/2025 4:19 PM] whiteshark2020
just run it and look choose 1
then choose 2 you can always use the original seed and run part 1 on iriginal, part 2 on original and see what moves

I decided to start again from scratch and farm each legendary for genuine codes bit by bit to build a data base of sorts around 50 of each seems about right but need to play the game a bit to get the unlocks in place for each boss/farm location.

Not sure if anyone else has tried this or not 🤔

The update they had today for gpt doesn't like borderlands


[10/5/2025 2:36 AM] cyber710
I didn't have this problem yesterday but got a notification when I got on today saying the memory was improved and since then gpt has been refusing to do lots


[10/5/2025 2:36 AM] unkempt3329
"improved" xD


[10/5/2025 2:38 AM] unkempt3329

Can anyone explain the whole mutations? I'm pretty new to modding and I was using the Gemini mutation to try and get codes as well as trying other codes when I drop it into the decryptor it just doesn't show up in lodt loot :/

[10/5/2025 3:53 AM] unkempt3329
They depend on how modified that item is, I usually keep mine at 4k each.


[10/5/2025 3:54 AM] unkempt3329
Including the NEW category.


[10/5/2025 3:54 AM] unkempt3329
The NEW category will ALWAYS have the longest serials.


[10/5/2025 3:54 AM] .zh.
then i assume increasing the tail limit will lead to more broken stuff


[10/5/2025 3:55 AM] .zh.
or leave that as be


[10/5/2025 3:55 AM] unkempt3329

hey so I have 3 weapon serials and 2 of them have the same parts. I want to put the parts from the first 2 codes onto the third one. is this possible with the gemini serial mutation engine, or is this just for generating random items? I don't really understand how to use it for what I want


[10/5/2025 10:22 AM] duke7000
@Mattmab making a start on a database would you be interested in the data it will be in format like this. Starting with Repkits as smallest pool.

This is actually really good for gathering and recording data on serials. I feel like we do need a "central database" with serials to reference

@BCD7000 (Duke) everyone would appreciate it.


[10/5/2025 11:19 AM] duke7000
genuine ones only too no modding involved that way we could literally have a god roll machine where the codes get updated that then gets used to help with modding we went down the modd like crazy route rather than the definitively Identify how normal codes are made first.

This would also go a long way if they then took all ingame codes and tweaked them a fraction and you could just compare items before and after and keep upto date/ahead of issue.

This is a huge undertaking though so will do Repkits and see how that goes to start with.
Using we mod to speed up farming with

100% drop chance - doing legendaries all the time would be pointless.
Teleport to save - Instantly next to boss (Farming Horace atm normally has a delay with hatch so bypassed that)
Teleport to waypoint as the reset is out in the open
Unlimited Jumps to jump to reset point 

quickest way so far


[10/5/2025 11:22 AM] duke7000
also the above template need to be tweaked as ingame items can actually have mutation's of the exact same items where everything is the same but then Instant Heal, Healing over time and cooldown change 🤣

ok gemini works more or less


[10/5/2025 12:53 PM] duke7000
Limited how? also do you pay for gemini as been using the free chatgpt to mutate codes and works well enough using the data I fed it.
I am just starting a fresh one with a different more structured approach this time.


[10/5/2025 12:56 PM] keiko324428
Well, with ChatGpt, if I'm not wrong there is a limited number of message you can do
Tho Gemini have a strange way to mutate serials that most of the time give nothing new or corrupt the item


[10/5/2025 12:58 PM] lancelotako16

most people here have been feeding AI the data themselves like this

person 1 - 2% mapped in their own personal ai
person 2 - 5% mapped in their own personal ai
person 3 -30% mapped in their own personal ai

and so on which is why everyone is on a different level - some people can create codes and others cant which is why I am farming some genuine data rather than constant mutations so for example you mutate a code for a rep kit 1000 times you get more sucessful results.

took a lot of hand iteration to find this


[10/5/2025 1:01 PM] whiteshark2020
my advise is to create a preformated document explaining core things to your AI
explaining what a serial is, what language it is base85
then explain theheader function and the tail 
explain what you actually trying todo and so on
feed the document instead of asking 50 questions. that why you stay in context and dont burn through your free daily limit

[10/5/2025 1:02 PM] whiteshark2020
also once you have a wworking generator ask for the python code so your independant of ai

[10/5/2025 1:03 PM] duke7000
Thats what I am doing with my second version more structured like I created 1 document that list every legendary in the game and so on for references so you start a new ai every so often so its cleaner each version.


[10/5/2025 1:04 PM] lancelotako16
From your notes each line are individual code + the tail end

cursor works like Vsstudio you have a project and stay within context als o writes and read straight from your files

have tested the limits? like how skills you could get into 1? im at 22 max for now but guess we can have waay more?

now is makes sense why when you sort items identical items are not grouped together as technically they are not on a coding level. This is annoying for farming.

we mod can 🤣 just set mine to 300 i think that 200 should be my pool limit or will neve get past 1 repkit type 🤣 then if there are true duplicate codes it is what it is 😉

Although if I get several and are all different it may bolster the timestamp idea.

i'm convinced there is some unique identifier, wether it is a timestamp or not

- paste the same serial into two inventory slots
- equip just one of them
=> the inventory says "item equipped" on **BOTH**

> _"can you expand more what you mean the items are the same but the serials are differnt"_

The "serials" you are working with ( `@Ug$lM....`) are encoded in base85.
Base85 associates GROUPS of four bytes into 5 characters, those are the "fragments" you are working with.
The problem with base85 is this: at a bit level, a single bitflip results in a WILDLY different base85 encoding.
This is because a single bitflip from any byte will affect the multiple characters of the fragment.

People have been feeding the serials into LLMs, and those LLM figured out "multiple fragment encoding schemes".
Answer: there is not, it's a sideeffect of working with the wrong data format.

Example:
We discovered that selling and buying back a weapon from a vending machine changes the serial.
- The serial gets longer
- Visually (in base85) it seems to be totally different.

```
Original: @Ugy3L+2}TYgOyvyviz?KiBDJYGs9dOW2m
Buyback:  @Ugy3L+2}Ta0Od!Hk&Y-`jLLDkno0@~lg(`;t
```
Do you notice any pattern between those two items?


[10/5/2025 4:36 PM] duke7000
All I have been doing is spawning in Horace and killing them then pick up the drops so when you say different if the tooltip is exactly the same do you mean this like kill the game restart and see if it changes the serials?


[10/5/2025 4:41 PM] nicnl
i don't realy understand your question


[10/5/2025 4:55 PM] duke7000
I say the serial are different but the results in game are the same
I notice some versions of the serial for these have near identical serials except for 4 characters
You ask me "Do you notice any pattern between those two items?"
If the Items are identical and from the same source.

What pattern are you asking me to look for if I have given you all the relevant information to how these items are obtained are well as the ingame code and screenshot?

You responses imply that you never checked in game the different codes produce the same items and think I am making it up when converting them to the code your using so I wont go down this path further with you and wish you luck.

In relation to the buy back yes I am aware as if you mutate a code and it reads as ?? you sell it and buy it back to get a valid code as I have done it before.


[10/5/2025 5:00 PM] nicnl
Here are the same two items, after performing the conversions we discovered

how do you use the stronger mutations ?@Mattmab


[10/5/2025 5:07 PM] blackberryshadoe
I'm sorry to jump into this conversation, but I have a question about the last part of your post concerning the selling items and then buying them back to get valid codes. The codes that have been released for modded items so far, have they been ran through that buyback to see if the codes stay the same?


[10/5/2025 5:08 PM] nicnl
I've never tried


[10/5/2025 5:09 PM] blackberryshadoe
To the best of my knowledge, no one else has tried that either. Hence why I'm asking the question. I might end up doing it just because I'm curious. If they are different, that would be very strange

I wonder what it does to that stupid infm Shield that's been wiping console backpack / Banks


[10/5/2025 5:21 PM] nicnl
there's an item that wipes stuff??

[10/5/2025 5:26 PM] blackberryshadoe
Was created by accident. It doesn't affect anything on PC so people didn't realize what it was doing until numerous reports started coming in from people on console. As a result, now codes are being tested for compatibility on Console before being released. Live and learn I guess


[10/5/2025 5:26 PM] shirtnoservice
Ah, it's because I already bought back that item before so it already has the code

[10/5/2025 5:27 PM] mattmab
@BlackberryShadoe that was on my list to try and modded items do sell and buyback from the vendor fine.


[10/5/2025 5:28 PM] blackberryshadoe
I figured that they do buy back, but I was curious whether the code changes as a result

Well at that point, which one is the right one


[10/5/2025 5:29 PM] mattmab
completely rewritten but on a bit level im sure its just part swapped with a bit of extra data like @Nicnl has been finding


[10/5/2025 5:29 PM] mattmab
the top was the one i posted


[10/5/2025 5:29 PM] mattmab
the bottom is buyback


[10/5/2025 5:30 PM] blackberryshadoe
wouldn't the buyback code actually be the correct one since it is being properly generated by the game


[10/5/2025 5:30 PM] mattmab
"properly" XD

remove the "vendor" data its identical

didn't seem so, no

I have been trying to make the same thing but with the amon kill skill activate on melee + forge drones + the affinity skills. Since the drones activate your kill skill, it auto max all your kill skill


[10/5/2025 11:02 PM] purevargos
It even activate the overkill specialization skill

I can't get some guns with a say a small based dmg on 4K up to 200K+. what part of the code would I randomize? Also does anyone have the cheat engine table so I can see what item code I'd like to extract?

I have around 157 peacemaker pool but logging each one is taking time 1/3 done but will lower the pool to around 50 going forward.
Here is an example utilising all fields

Tried this method with Repkits and doesn't seem to follow the same pattern. Tail seems to have no affect but copying each 4 indexs from the middle cloning it then throwing it in mutation engine does not seem to yeild any results except a repkit with a single perk stat lol 

losing my mind


[10/6/2025 2:55 PM] mattmab
most my work has revolved around class mods enhancements and a small set of weapons. finnity xxxl koledisplode and hot slugger the wombo combo. if repkits dont follow the same logic then may need a different approach


[10/6/2025 2:56 PM] internal9871
Yeah i'm trying to understand it as a programatic approach but it seems to have a certain set to delulu to it

removed a bit from the 2nd item to see it if would remove 1 perk but it removed perks out of order... Going for stacking nova's and cloning doesn't work

Thanks for all your work on class mods. I can’t wait to see what you come out with next

Thats why when I started farming them I found out you could have unique codes for the exact same repkit effects which was not known at the time.


[10/6/2025 3:19 PM] internal9871
I am noticing that currently just picked up something silimar and the codes are the same sooo i'm like ughhh


[10/6/2025 3:19 PM] duke7000
almost halfway logging them farming is so much quicker than logging them 🤣


[10/6/2025 3:20 PM] duke7000
I was killing Horace so fast that I was killing him again before the legendaries even finished dropping 🤣


[10/6/2025 3:26 PM] internal9871
i don't have that speed i just use killenemies console command for farming certain types of things lol


[10/6/2025 3:28 PM] internal9871
right now i'm only picking up repkits to see what the deal is. doesn't seem like mutating the middle gets much of anything with legendries either the item becomes washed away or it just reverts to having only the legendary stat it comes with 

I could be doing everything wrong as i just start tinkering with this today during work lol


[10/6/2025 3:38 PM] internal9871
was able to manually splice to make a modded repkit 
```@Uge8#%m/)@{!caS)M-}RPG}@#Z8r1n{eo3Q2osZ_1RFPXE00{bV&g```

the { is a break between effects seems like they are 4 - 8 characters long so splace and nova are in the {eo3Q2osZ_1RFPXE00 section while the closing { is from the 2nd item i spliced from

It only works so well if the reset point or boss is outside as wemod has 2 teleports

1. Fixed you can save - set this near horace and bypassing the hatch opening delay for the chute
2. Tied to your waypoint - teleport outside

Then just use unlimited jumps 😉

flags are just for you to sort by. and there is no answer to that question untill the serials have a library we can referance

So you are aware whiteshark the sections we have been finding are part of a whole 2 to 3 characters make up many parts.


[10/6/2025 9:52 PM] whiteshark2020
im dumping everytime the convos in my cursor he interprets it and that E1 i told my ai dont focus on tht bl parts need to be compatible you cant just install anything on any gun mostly brand locked


[10/6/2025 9:53 PM] whiteshark2020
it asked to make a script to detect the parts and tommorow ill test the script to see if he can pinpoint every gun parts on the blocks


[10/6/2025 9:53 PM] whiteshark2020
@Mattmab


[10/6/2025 9:54 PM] whiteshark2020
the end script should tell me all part detected on a seed


[10/6/2025 9:54 PM] whiteshark2020
im using the docu from @Nicnl


[10/6/2025 9:54 PM] whiteshark2020
that he meticulously document


[10/6/2025 9:56 PM] whiteshark2020
Ah! That's a crucial insight! You're saying that the 2-3 character sections we've been finding (like mzS59, sCuY(, dZ>3h) are actually part of a whole - they're components that make up many parts together.
So instead of thinking:
mzS59 = 1 barrel part
sCuY( = 1 stock part
dZ>3h = 1 magazine part
It's more like:
Multiple 2-3 character sections combine to form 1 complete barrel
Multiple 2-3 character sections combine to form 1 complete stock
Multiple 2-3 character sections combine to form 1 complete magazine
This explains why:
Our single pattern insertions aren't working properly
We need multiple related patterns to form complete parts
The working modded seeds probably have complete part sets
We're inserting incomplete parts that cause malus
So we need to:
Identify complete part sets (multiple related patterns)
Insert entire part sets instead of individual patterns
Study the working modded seeds to see their complete part combinations
Understand the part structure better
This is a much more complex system than we initially thought! Should I create a system that analyzes complete part sets instead of individual patterns?


[10/6/2025 10:02 PM] mattmab
exactly white


[10/6/2025 10:02 PM] mattmab
when taken down to hex and binary and put in the right order parts can be sort of read. but hard to determine exactly whats going on right now. more research is needed.


[10/6/2025 10:05 PM] whiteshark2020
yh i see he just wrote  an seed analyzer to chk that
Key Findings:
Working Seed 1 has 3 complete parts:
2 stock parts (155e15ee) at positions 8 and 12
1 barrel part (e9e9e9e9) at position 32
Pattern Relationships:
Barrel patterns: mzS, S59, Pmz, 9mz - these are the 2-3 character components
Stock patterns: sCu, CuY, EsC - these combine to form complete stock parts
