With GbxGame.CSVStatColumn + NumberToGenerate, we should be able to understand what each part represents because we can even extract the weapon code before it is encoded

Still need to be tested

No, I saw that changing the level of the item sometimes breaks, unless you remove the flag. Once removed it finally spawned but it spawned without a level


[9/18/2025 8:52 PM] s4mzy.
do u still have the item code?


[9/18/2025 8:53 PM] s4mzy.
it would be good to see the item code beforehand and after with the pictures corresponding to what has changed

Some enums that make me think they *could* use oodle compression also for serial numbers, but doubtful

Good news; definitely getting somewhere with the UI stuff. Trying to output the entire `eventData` object to the item card, to see what's sent from the `window.engine` callback.

Bad news is I just keep breaking the UI

Logging works for items, but it seems they're just plain objects, and not any unique class. I did catch some calls to the engine, but nothing about getting responses yet. Looks like my next steps will be to investigate the engine RPC from the coherent ui.
Probably tomorrow though, good luck everyone!

I feel like the pattern is somewhat as follows

Magic Number, Item Base/Manufacturer, Level, and then an "array" of modifiers. The above images slightly allude to that. Until we can get UE4SS working, I'm probably going to put a pause on it because brute forcing can eventually work, but if they change the seed or generation method even the slightest, all the work would be gone.

you might need to add the skin unlocks to your profile.sav as well


[9/22/2025 7:15 PM] it_corvo
profile shows them as unlockable but idk how to edit that so they aren't lol (since they dont drop just doesnt complete the challenge)

now that it looks like people are able to see and change code values. I wonder how long until we get a chart that shows which parts are which to make it easier to translate. I can just imagine how much longer it will be before we have drop downs with part names and affects in a GUI


[9/23/2025 8:48 AM] wetillusions
Especially with AI now. Should just be able to provide common values and AI spit out some sort of pattern :ElonSmoke:

I had AI writing me basic hotkey scripts for other games

[9/27/2025 5:59 AM] drnha
Use a old sdk or find a new one


[9/27/2025 5:59 AM] drnha
If u want i can send u sdk files

In pakfiles it seems at least for what we've been able to extract, a lot of the balances are in scripts

dumb question is black loot even a thing no more or thats gone gone i remember hearing it was something related to editing the code to glitch it or default to black rarity for bl2


[9/27/2025 10:21 PM] haubitzen
it was a thing then\


[9/27/2025 10:21 PM] haubitzen

[9/27/2025 10:21 PM] haubitzen
only sandman will tell us of that


[9/27/2025 10:42 PM] sairouth
outside of "sanity saver" mod for bl2 if you are on pc, or having to reload your save every time you are wanting to play with it. "Black rarity" aka Hybrids are only on bl2.

we already have modded weapons with mixing some parts and here there, don't think we've mixed pistol with shotgun type of thing, but who knows. We are still very new to modding items for this game

so I am manually messing around with plasma coil codes to try and see what part does what starting with codes that are really similar, with one set I was able to swap the mag and grip, but  with the next set even though there where 4 different codes I ended up with just 2 sets of identical guns.

Rarity, model/class/main legendary. Part of acceptable table. Shouldn't see a significant difference. Between them. As they are just different valid bytes

[9/29/2025 12:00 AM] akamoden
see blocks A and B


[9/29/2025 12:01 AM] akamoden
thats the Tilling, which means if you change at a seam, it'll change part of the tail. and will change what table rolls onto the gun.


[9/29/2025 12:03 AM] akamoden
as we can see, 0-5 bytes are the same. and then again at byte 21, these are all valid rolls for the gun, however, long story short each attachment, like a grip or a barrel or sight adds stats. and so you can mix them because the game will allow it but naturally it wouldnt.


[9/29/2025 12:03 AM] orinx
so because the code is slightly encrypted / compressed  each part of the str isn't a 1 to 1 correlation to weapon part?


[9/29/2025 12:03 AM] akamoden
so when changing bytes you're changing the rolls, which inturn changes what attachments are on the gun.


[9/29/2025 12:04 AM] akamoden
correct!


[9/29/2025 12:04 AM] wetillusions
Ooooo, how did you do this plz


[9/29/2025 12:04 AM] orinx
oh the str is the rng seed for the part rolls?


[9/29/2025 12:04 AM] akamoden
yes


[9/29/2025 12:05 AM] orinx
ah kind of cool, is there a way to reverse the seed or at least use that tool you have to see what parts it accualy is modifying?


[9/29/2025 12:06 AM] orinx
and I guess what ever is making the "seed" isn't pure random as there is way to many repeating parts for pure randomness


[9/29/2025 12:07 AM] akamoden
so earlier in the chat, the guy dumped alot of info on how the game determines what table it picks from. currently. no one that i've found has reversed that part. but im sure someone will, my tool currently only allows you to see tilling, see bytes. reencode 1:1 with GBX etc. i have no codex for parts yet.


[9/29/2025 12:07 AM] orinx
ah


[9/29/2025 12:08 AM] akamoden
and this is how they get 30 billion guns.


[9/29/2025 12:08 AM] akamoden
so alot of math, general checks. parts list. etc.


[9/29/2025 12:09 AM] akamoden
we need the parts list and then my tool can make guns. and just about everyone else would be able aswel.


[9/29/2025 12:09 AM] orinx
ya in bl3 at the start I was just copying parts of the gun memory from one to another of the same length to get the anointments I wanted.


[9/29/2025 12:09 AM] orinx
but the in game part viewer helped


[9/29/2025 12:10 AM] akamoden
i think the CT does something similar to that, that someone used. im just lazy and don't want to build a codex. i spent alot of time making my tool but people are happy with free handing edits right now.


[9/29/2025 12:10 AM] akamoden
until there is a need for my tool in the general sense im just leaving it be.


[9/29/2025 12:11 AM] akamoden
but whenever you wanna see two different guns compared let me know. if you need me to change bytes. i can do that too.

[9/29/2025 12:41 AM] akamoden
0-5 exactly the same. which is like the type of gun it is, the foundation for this weapon. after this, is everything else. and the tail length is different, which means the bytes get encoded differently.

[9/29/2025 12:46 AM] akamoden
these A and B blocks only really matter when it comes to extremes. right so like these couldnt merge or would have to be merged at the tail section, but if you merge two items with the same Tiling, you could get a mix of the two. if you knew what to swap or splice. the chance for success goes up with tail merges or mutations by alot. this is why gernades and sheilds and all that stuff is so easy to mutate. because the tails on those are essentially the whole thing. the mid section is where the game will reject it if its not percise. or a known value for that table. if that makes sense.

Latest info I have is to find out same item on different levels then figure out the change, however this is a limit.


[10/1/2025 2:51 PM] orinx
Looking at legendary items with mostly fixed parts then try to find one with the only difference being the level will help narrow it down.

Whats success rate?


[10/2/2025 1:17 PM] inflamedsebi
So, I read a bit of the topic, but I am not quite sure if I understand it.
1) The serial string is not the encoded weapon but a seed on how to roll this weapon?
Which means every restart of the game would reroll all weapons, but since it is seeded, it will reroll the same weapon.
But if we reverse the seed, we can change and control which parts to roll.

2) Seeds have different lengths because of a different amount of parts (makes sense), but are divided in prefix,mid,tail.
prefix defines type, but what differentiates mid and tail and how do you know when mid ends and tail starts?

3) (26, 21, 'mid') (10, 8, 'tail') Why are there 2 values? Isn't this the length value of mid and tail?


[10/2/2025 1:30 PM] inflamedsebi
4) Apparently peeps agreed on dividing the seed to 8bit/2hex blocks. Do we know this, or is it just an assumption?
like couldn't each part consist of 12 bit? first 4 for a manufacturer last 8 for the actual part?


[10/2/2025 1:54 PM] orinx
4) some parts seem to be 4 bits and there might other 2 bit parts that push things out of alignment, that from someone who tested changing gun scopes.

[10/2/2025 2:18 PM] inflamedsebi
oh i see, yeah that's what i was worried about. However if there is variable length to parts itself, there must be a way to determine the length because they would need to know as well.
So either they work with fixed positions (which the apparently do not) or the use some other witchery like utf8 does for example, where each part determines the bit length at the beginning, so you would always know when to stop and a new part starts.


[10/2/2025 2:32 PM] orinx
There is something that can make item codes vary in length even without converting guns that on the surface look to only be one part different


[10/2/2025 2:47 PM] inflamedsebi
Well this absolutely sounds like this. the seed probably looks completely different in general, since most parts are shifted ...


[10/2/2025 2:48 PM] inflamedsebi
imma get some python ide and comparing seed on  bit level ... maybe i can find some pattern ...

Anything for just editing legit gear?

Like for spawning grolls


[10/4/2025 6:43 AM] burrmane
does this method not you just give you random modded gear to skim through ?


[10/4/2025 6:49 AM] cyber710
Yeah it does just give you random modded items to go through


[10/4/2025 6:49 AM] cyber710
But that's the method we use for everything


[10/4/2025 6:49 AM] cyber710

If your referring to the methods discussed in Matt's post yeah


[10/4/2025 7:19 AM] burrmane
is there any way to add specific rolls to a specific weapon or is everything just random


[10/4/2025 7:22 AM] cyber710
Just random basically you can take a specific serial and figure out what part does what and go from there Matt's post talks bout how to do that

But we ain't got like a tool or data base to help with that it's just manual you got to test and test to figure it out so random lol


[10/4/2025 7:23 AM] cyber710
Sorry I'm half asleep my explanation probably not the best just go to the top of the post linked ealier and go through the whole thing

You'll learn lots


[10/4/2025 7:27 AM] burrmane
i get it, i‚Äôm just a little confused what part of the serial i should replace, or just add on to it


[10/4/2025 7:28 AM] cyber710
I can't tell you the exact part cause idk but it's normally near the middle of the serial kinda the middle end it that makes any sense


[10/4/2025 7:28 AM] cyber710
But the middle in general is normally where all the stuff you would want to change is


[10/4/2025 8:30 AM] inflamedsebi
editing the @U serial is the same like chnaging random bits in the data and hoping for the best, since the serial is a compressed format of the gun data.
right now we compare guns on the hex/binary level to identify more precise sections. We managed to swap scopes on snipers consistently.
Not really useful but helps to understand the format.
we also discovered selling and buying back guns does change the serial, despite being the exact same gun, so we are comparing those too.


[10/4/2025 8:30 AM] inflamedsebi
This is a bought back gun on hex level comparison, so the are somewhat close and lining up.
while the repeating parts are very likely to be the guns parts. but we are still having trouble to figure out, where each part starts and ends and what else might be around there

[10/4/2025 8:32 AM] inflamedsebi
however on @U serial level comparison the look very different for the same gun.
So comparing @U serials and editing them directly is just pure luck

sigh, so far of all my Super Soldier shields I have been able to get 4 legendries on them at times, the only one I'm looking for is Bundled, but normally I always get the SS effect along with Wings of Grace and Oscar Mike effect, with the 4th effects so far being constellation and color spray when I can get a 4th one to show upchat gpt taking years to answer simple questions now I've had it "learning" for so damn long

Create an SDK for the game using dumper-7. I feel like we need to be looking into the game files to see if we can figure out how they are building serials for items. Until we do that, modded items will always just be a guessing game.


[10/4/2025 10:25 AM] drnha
Let me get this right, u inject dumper 7 and say ur doing something?


[10/4/2025 10:26 AM] drnha
Have u done anything with the SDK?
Have u loaded the files in a c++ dll project in visual studio and made a test dll to inject yet?

All u did was download dumper 7, inject it to the game, uploaded the sdk here, does that sound like it was worth ur time?
If ur point was to go though the game code to figure out the Serials, ur not doing it right, U dont dump objects to reverse engineer functions, u use IDA or ghidra

If u do a offset check on the files and do a text comparison youll find pretty much no changes, youll find extra objects in the object dump / size changes there but thats only because how dumper7 and other dumpers dump offsets,
They dump from all the UObjectArray Chunks, causing instanced objects to get dumped


[10/4/2025 10:39 AM] drnha
Instanced objects should be ignored from dumps as u will not see it in your game instance

I've been at this for days using chatGPT, plugging in every and all modded items that show up in the discord/downloaded saves from nexus with modded items and explained specifically to  chatgpt what they were, the order I noticed things in ect for one goal and one goal only. I want an Energy Shield that has both the Super Soldier effect and the Fireworks Effect. Using the Super soldier base brand code, which is the same as trhe Guardian angel, I have gotten chatGPT to spit me out literally at this point, over 100k, differernt mutations over the past however many days, all tested, and the closest it can get is to put the same legendaries we've seen on everything in whatever differernt order on the Super Soldier shield. My question, has ANY one seend Bundled "the fireworks perk" show up on ANYTHING that is not the Fireworks base brand code? Because looking over the discord and my modified save items, literally nothing but the fireworks shield has even gotten that effect. 

TL:DR has any one seen "bundled" on anything besides a fireworks/armor shield?


[10/6/2025 9:01 PM] derder
Like at this point I could go in and probably tell it whatever specific combo of lego effects we already have seen pop up on everything tell it I want it to have super capacity, a fracking underbarrel attachment, and 9 normal perks and it could probably spit out 10k codes half of which would be excatly what I asked for, but when I tell it to try and get Bundled on there, it bricks just about every single code, or it just ends up like every other mega modified version, but without bundled.

that you can, or at least, legendary effects


[10/6/2025 10:01 PM] derder
I've gotten jacobs legendaries, other brand legendaries, all to show up on the SS shield


[10/6/2025 10:01 PM] derder
just not Bundled


[10/6/2025 10:02 PM] derder
granted I haven't tried using the fireworks base and trying to get SS perk on it but I beleieve I read that even though that could be done the SS perk won't work because it HAS to be an energy shield for the perk to work.


[10/6/2025 10:02 PM] derder
might be wrong about that though as I haven't specifically tested that myself, only going off of what I've seen others say


[10/6/2025 10:03 PM] derder
you can also shields to roll different brand normal perks so again, not sure why Bundled is being an issue.


[10/6/2025 10:05 PM] derder
if it's as simple as you can't have an armor effect on an energy shield through any logic than that's fine, just wish I knew know rather than wonder if I'm wasting my time trying to get ChatGPT to figure it out


[10/6/2025 10:07 PM] derder
and now relooking through shields I have made, I have many that rolled with "Vintage" wich is the Jacobs shield Old Age Cask Legendary, which is also an armor shield so, there goes that theory


[10/6/2025 10:07 PM] derder

not currently, also I noticed that on my shields that did roll Vintage, it changed them all into Armor Shields, so I still may be on to something, I just don't know what

and looking at the legendary shield list, eveyr single brand shares the exact same shield type, no differences, ie. all order are energy, all torgue are armor ect

Here is what ChatGPT has broken down into known rules for me or whatever for shield generaion (I've only been truly focusing on the Super Soldier Shield, so grain of salt blah blah blah) if this helps any one.
